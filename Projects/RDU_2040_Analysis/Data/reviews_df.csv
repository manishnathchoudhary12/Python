16,The public lands and trail networks at Umstead State Park & Lake Crabtree County Park have great value to the community. They are heavily used and use is growing. This land has highpotential if park land are protected & enhanced through integration of trail networks.,6/28/2015
17,Public Transportation to the Triangle City centers is important for tourism. The airport should be commended for supporting the USO. I hop the support will continue.,6/28/2015

29,"I don't know; I love RDU the way it is, and it's not the concrete jungle like most major airports. It's like an airport in a park. I'm very weary of development, because I find RDU convenient enoughalready - and so do many folks I talk to. Besides, there is a cemetery there, and it should be kept quiet and respectful. Suggestion (as I'm not going to be able to make it to the meeting):Raleigh, being the capital, I feel does not pay tribute enough to our state's honor of being first in flight; a little North Carolina aviation history sprinkled throughout RDU, maybe a small museum,would be *excellent!*",6/29/2015
30,"Anyone who lived here through the 70’s and 80’s will remember all too well RDU Airport’s notorious Plan B Expansion initiative. That plan, which very nearly came to fruition, would have turnedmajor runways 180 degrees, paralleling Rt. 40 and sending low-flying air traffic directly over Umstead State Park, Meredith College and NC State, not to mention the homes of thousands of newTriangle residents who thought they’d made wise decisions, choosing to purchase their new homes in quiet residential areas likely to increase in value. It took years for citizens of this area tofight RDU to a standstill, forcing them to back down, retain their existing runway configuration, and avoid turning the noise corridor such that it was in total conflict with decades of land useplanning designed to be compatible with the noise impact of overflights. TRIANGLE CITIZENS BEWARE . . . do not fail to inform yourselves about this new airport master planninig process orto take this opportunity to ensure the RDU Airport Authority does not try once again to take away the peace and tranquility of your neighborhoods and the value of your properties in its drive toprovide an “efficient airport in a cost-effective (!!!) manner”.

55,"Dear RDU team:The writer Voltaire famously stated the universal principle “with great power comes great responsibility”. This principle led me to contact you today to talk about the issue of aircraft noise.First of all, I would like to congratulate you on your extraordinary achievements with the Raleigh-Durham Airport. Undoubtedly, the airport as well as the entire metro area around it havebenefited enormously from your work. As a frequent business traveler, I personally use RDU a lot, and I can say that the airport you are responsible for is one of the most sophisticated andefficient ones I have ever seen.In addition to being a heavy user of RDU, however, I am also a concerned resident in a community located within the airport’s area of noise impact. A direct flight path for departures above myhouse has led me into a love-hate relationship with the airport.Only an unreasonable person would not support economic growth or understand the unavoidable consequences of operating an airport. However, it is also easy to fall into the trap of forgettingabout other important aspects of life for the sake of economic growth. Sometimes, the focus on economic growth will even damage the underlying reasons that initiated and sustained thegrowth in the first place - in this case: the high quality of life in Raleigh-Durham.When my wife and I moved into the metro area three years ago, we learned that some of its nicest and most appealing neighborhoods are located in the Morrisville-Cary area. In fact, welearned that the high quality of life in specifically these neighborhoods had contributed significantly to the influx of professional talent into the region and thus to its economic growth. Quality oflife was also the main driver for us in our decision to move into one of these neighborhoods.When we came here, we did expect a certain level of aircraft noise given the proximity to the airport. However, over time, the more we heard about economic growth and expansion, the less weheard about efforts to preserve quality of life for the future. We heard a lot about past achievements and how the noise situation is better now than it was in the 1980’s, but we could not findmuch on what to expect for the future.I once called RDU’s noise officer, and when I told him that continuous aircraft noise had been accepted as a serious threat to health and wellbeing by numerous scientists and airport leaders inEurope for a long time now, he answered “this is America, not Europe.” I never quite understood what exactly he wanted to convey with that, but I was certainly left confused about the level ofimportance that noise will receive in RDU’s plans for the future.In sum, I understand that I live close to the airport. I also understand that the best solution to aircraft noise will be future innovation in jet engine technology, which is something that is not underyour control but will hopefully come to benefit us all soon.

But, RDU provides no information on its planningprinciples in its documentation. Does RDU have a standing policy about about interactions with and impacts to its biggest neighbor, Umstead? If not, then now is the time. Its the first logicalstep in the planning process. Further, If RDU is interested in exchanging property with Umstead State Park, then it should be reflected in this master planning process. The inventory of RDUlands should immediately be expanded to include land, water and biological characteristics appropriate for consideration of inclusion to a State Park.

I would like to hearabout funding avenues for future expansion at future planning meetings. While airport revenues may have been exhausted, alternative souces could be considered to minimize the need for non-aernautical land development.

Please increase sppedlimits on Brantley Blvd at areas not directly at the terminal. A distinct Terminal 3 with separate parking, roadway, check-in, etc. seems excessive given forecasted demand. T1 seemsunderutilized (gates/surface area) and less crowded, so additions to both T1 and T2 should be used rather than solely expanding T2. The observation park is be far my favorite thing aboutRDU.

On a separate note, many of my prime staff (young, educated, technocentric) employees use the area surrounding the airport formountain bikingm running, hiking and kayaking on Lake Crabtree. The proximity between Research Triangle Park and Umstead and Lake Crabtree are attractive assets when selling mycompany to potential employees that could move to Boston, San Diego, DC, or other areas.

I would love to see as much of the green space saved as possible. This land should be developed in a waythat showcases our beautiful land, not just shops, offices, stores which everyone has. One idea is an IMBA (International Mountain Bike Association) ride center that could be built adjacent tothe airport. People would fly here for that and it would bring lots of people to the area. There is nothing like that in this state yet. We need to maintain Lake Crabtree and the trails that go with it.It is the most heavily used park in the Wake County system. Please consider doing something out-of-the ordinary that benefits the quality of life here. Another quarry is not what we need.Getting rid of an existing park is not either.

142,"As a resident of Chapel Hill and Durham for most of my life, I've gotten the pleasure to see the area grow tremendously over the last 30 or so years, including our airport. I currently live inDurham and work in Raleigh, and my family uses RDU Airport several times a year, mainly to fly to the west coast. Of the alternatives provided in the Master Plan, none by themselves stand outas a clear favorite. However, there are concepts within several of the alternatives that I like for various reasons.Alternative 2 is the only option that allows for complete post-security connectivity between all commercial gates. Most other airports allow for connectivity between terminals without having toleave secured space. By allowing this, RDU would put itself in a more flexible situation in regards to airlines availability to use gates in multiple terminals, and would remove potential barriersthat are currently blocking airlines from expanding their service even more to RDU.Alternatives 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 provide the most commercial-length runways, since Alternatives 2 and 9 would construct a replacement runway for 14/32, which is considerably smaller thancommercial aircraft can use. I think that having more runways that are serviceable to commercial flights would provide the most opportunity for growth.Alternatives 4, 6, and 7 integrate the rental car facilities with the public parking and transit, which is very convenient when I experience this at other airports. It also consolidates the overall planto the immediate terminal area, which allows for other ventures to be realized in the other areas of the property.To conclude, each alternative has aspects that would be of substantial improvement to the current facilities. My suggestion would be to utilize the terminal and gate configuration shown inAlternative 2, and construct the runway and parking/rental car/transit facilities shown in Alternatives 4, 6, or 7.",6/8/2016

As a frequent flyer for business (e.g., 40+ RDU departures each year since1996) I have seen many changes at RDU. I have not spent a lot of time reviewing the plans in detail but wanted to make a few general comments first:1) Please add a cell phone lot;2) Passenger Pick up at Terminal 2 needs substantial improvement – especially if adding gates;3) Add a right turn lane for the back exit onto W. International Drive to keep traffic flowing more efficiently; and4) Please consider the addition of Free Wi-Fi (many airports have it now).Regarding the plans, I favor expansion on the Terminal 2 side. As an avid supporter of Umstead State Park and our green-ways, I strongly oppose any development that moves closer to thepark since you can already hear the airport noise when you are hiking and trying to remove yourself from the cityscape.I specifically favor Alternatives 6, 7, & 8 for the plans presented. Expansion is preferred over building a new terminal and in my experience, less confusing for travelers to have one long terminalrather than having to take a tram or bus (horrible option!) to another terminal.I hope to attend the 28JUN2016 meeting.

145,"June 9 2016To: RDU Airport AuthorityRe: Nine Alternatives, Vision 2040 Master Plan , presented to public June 1 and 2 2016From: The Umstead Coalition, info@umsteadcoalition.orgIn 1980 and 1994 The Umstead Coalition, with active participation from citizens and local/state governments and other stakeholders worked to ensure the Master Plan does NOT put a runwaycloser to William B. Umstead State Park. And, most importantly, no increased ‘taking’ of Park land by noise generated by the RDU Airport.Please accept these comments as preliminary feedback on the 9 alternatives presented at the June 1 and 2, 2016 Public Meetings. The land use/development plan will be integral to how theRDU Airport interacts with the community and its surrounding land owners, including William B. Umstead State Park. As such, it is difficult to give a full evaluation of the alternatives without theland use/development plans associated with each alternative.Our recommendation for the 9 alternatives presented is NOT to include any aviation or land use alternative that increases noise for William B. Umstead State Park users. For example, itappears that Alternatives 1, 2 and 9 may be detrimental to William B. Umstead State Park due to construction of runways closer to William B. Umstead State Park.The relocation of the General Aviation Runway such that it does NOT point aircraft over William B. Umstead State Park could provide decreased aircraft noise to William B. Umstead State Parkusers and should be considered in the selected alternatives.William B. Umstead State Park is protected by several State and Federal laws and regulations. These include:Precedent from the Agreement between the U.S Department of Transportation and the Department of the Interior. In 1970, an agreement was reached between the U.S Dept. of Transportationand the Department of the Interior that noise levels in the Everglades National Park, "" shall not be greater than a Composite Noise Rating (CNR) of 90 (equivalent to 55 LDN).” We have beenconcerned that the 55 LDN line penetrates far inside Umstead Park. We would request that any RDU Airport Master Plan strives to DECREASE aircraft noise to Park users, not increase.Section 4(f) of the U.S. Department of Transportation Act of 1965, Section 138 of Title 23, USC states:""It is hereby declared to be the national policy that special effort should be made to preserve the natural beauty of the countryside and public park and recreation lands, wildlife and waterfowlrefuges, and historic sites. The Secretary of Transportation shall cooperate and consult with the Secretaries of the Interior, Housing and Urban Development, and Agriculture, and with thestates in developing transportation plans and programs that include measures to maintain or enhance the natural beauty of lands traversed.....The Secretary shall not approve any program orproject which requires the use of any publicly owned land from a public park, recreation area or wildlife and waterfowl refuge of national state, or local significance....unless (1) there is nofeasible and prudent alternative to the use of such land, and (2) such program includes all possible planning to minimize harm to such park...... resulting from such use.""Section 4(f) can be invoked either by the physical taking or the use of land. In the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in the Brook vs. Volpe case (March 2, 1972), the court held that theintroduction of noise levels into a recreation area is a ""taking of land"" and is subject to Section 4(f) requirements.Section 6(f) of the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund Act (PL88-578).

146,Having recently moved to Raleigh from .the Baltimore area we would like to recommend the parking system used at BWI. The system uses lights to identify open parking spots. If the spot isoccupied the light is red. If the spot is open the light is green. It is so easy to find a parking spot with this system. Our brief experience with RDU has been very positive with the exception ofinadequate parking signage over the holidays. Having given up on finding a spot in the garage we opted for long term parking. After driving all the way over to the lot we found it was full.Signage at the terminals should have informed us that the lot was full. Enhanced parking would be a plus.,6/11/2016
147,"On May 25 I was at Sycamore Group Camp Mess Hall, 8:00 - 8:30 a.m. (Wm. B. Umstead State Park). My morning was Not peaceful and quiet due to all the aircraft taking off. It reminded meof time I lived at Incirlik A. B. Turkey and the build up to the 1st Gulf War. I lived next to the main runway and the constant air traffic taking off and landing. That is part of living on a NATOairbase during war time. Not something I'd expect while visiting Umstead State Park early in the a.m. for some quiet time away from everyday life noise, traffic and hub-bub.We want a Reduction of air traffic over the park, Not an increase. Changing runway 14-32 to be parallel to other runways would be progress towards this. And a major runway should not be builtcloser to Umstead State Park if that would result in increased noise in the Park.",6/13/2016
148,"I will have to say that I am a bit concerned with the way this process is playing out on a few fronts. It seems like meetings are not announced very far in advance, at least in I any public forumand that it is not clear how public comments will be taken or if they will even be considered in the process at all.For instance, as of this writing on June 13 there is no mention of whe the 4th meeting if hit be where the non aviation operations land will be talked about. I have heard through another sourcethat this meeting will be held June 28 possibly, which is just two weeks away. For a public meeting that does not seem like enough notice. Also, is there any official forum other than this websubmittal for comments?Also, I am quite concerned that 3 of the 9 plans shown have additional or replacement runways shown Southeast of current runway facilities. For at least 20 years, all that has been talked aboutand shown has been a third runway to the Northwest of the current facilities. People have been able to rely on this information published by the airport authority and have made decisions basedupon that. To now potentially turn around and do an about face is not exactly engendering good feelings as how the rest of this process will go and how friendly it will be to the general public.I call on the Airport Authority to abandon all plans that add runways in any location other than where it has been shown for two decades.Thanks",6/13/2016
149,"As a valuable part of the community, RDU must take a leadership role in protecting our unique natural resources. Umstead Park is an historic treasure and a natural resource that isunparalleled in other metropolitan areas. Any development plans must protect Umstead and not impinge on it with development or aircraft noise.RDU not only has a chance to protect Umstead, but is also uniquely positioned to enhance the park. For instance, by protecting the corridor along Old Reedy Creek Road that connects LakeCrabtree to Umstead along the banks of Crabtree Creek. The banks of Crabtree Creek in this area are a sensitive microenvironment with species that are only common a few hundred miles tothe West. Moreover, this provides a continuous passageway for wildlife stretching for miles from Morrisville all the way to North Raleigh.Lake Crabtree County Park is a cherished location providing recreation opportunities in a quickly growing and increasingly dense part of the Triangle. With near complete commercialdevelopment of the remaining banks of the lake, this park provides recreation access to the lake as well as mountain bike and running/hiking trails, picnic areas, wide grassy fields and so muchmore.There are countless users of these resources and we will remain highly involved in this process. We only hope that RDU will show itself to be an ally of the residents in the Triangle area.",6/14/2016

154,"Greetings, I am a 21 year old who has a passion for aviation and have always enjoyed being around RDU, my home airport. I have watched the airport expand throughout the past ten years,from the construction of Terminal 2 to the new Paris flight, I cannot be any prouder as an aviation geek to watch RDU grow the way it has. As soon as I saw the 9 alternatives released from thepublic workshops, I was eager to see how RDU may grow and through my suggestions out there, to be more specific, a combination of some of the concepts in the alternatives brought up tothe public.I really like the ""wrap-around Terminal 3"" proposal and the ""future aviation development"" section to the east of runway 5R/23L in alternative 2. A new runway parallel to runway 5L/23R would begood to complement Terminal 2 ops as mentioned in several of the proposals, ideally a runway with a length of at least 8,000ft with flexibility to grow to 10,000 ft like the current 5L/23R runway.As far as the rental car facilities and the ground transportation center, I like the proposal in alternative 3, seeing those consolidated into a new facility on National Guard Drive, ideally connectedwith a people mover connection similar to the one in alternative 8 going out along John Brantley Blvd. on the eastern side, down Aviation Parkway to the new Ground Transportation Center onNational Guard Drive. The people mover can have a terminus somewhere where the current ParkRDU Central garage is to allow convenient access to Terminals 1, 2, and the new wrap-aroundTerminal 3. Lastly, should a time come where if even more capacity is needed, possibly due to an airline starting hub operations at RDU or ""more than expected growth"", they could be placed ina remote terminal similar to the one in Alternatives 3, 4, and 5.That being said, if I could only chose one of the nine alternatives mentioned, it would be alternative 2, but with a parallel 8,000 or 10,000 ft runway to 5L/23R. I am very excited to see how RDUwill grow in the future, especially with the new Paris flight and a possible Asia flight to Beijing to accommodate the travel needs of Lenovo. Thank you and I look forward to seeing my homeairport grow!Regards",6/28/2016

156,As a frequent visitor to Lake Crabtree I want to say that the best use for the airport authority land south of I-40 is green space. This is a buffer to the intense development of the airport and anactive public space. It is very successful. Keep it as it is and the airport authority will be well loved for doing so. Sell the green space that is now trails and bike paths to developers and theauthority will be seen as a poor steward. Please do the right thing for the Triangle.

By eliminating the existing parks and surrounding areas to RDU,you are taking away one of the most important treasures we have. There are a number of existing industrial and office complexes that are sitting empty right now, so the need to build more onlyserves to benefit the builder, unless the airport authority is planning on using the empty space as a tax write-off. Shame on the airport authority for even thinking that the best path forward wouldbe to bulldoze and build. If it's more money that the authority is after, perhaps more on time flights and more efficient use of existing dollars would be more beneficial. Ripping out acres uponacres of trees isn't the solution. I vehemently oppose bulldozing a single tree on the proposed parcels.

201,"I have attended several of the meetings that RDU has held concerning the future development of the airport. I understand that the facility needs to grow and also to generate revenue to abideby its agreements with the FAA. Because I am a frequent user of the trails at Lake Crabtree County Park and Umstead State Park, I have remained interested in the development of the site andsurrounding areas.Last night I saw what I feared most, the destruction of LCCP and surrounding trails on the site plan presented by the airport authority. It's not clear when LCCP will become an office park, but itis definitely on the agenda. It seems particularly short-sighted to place an office park on recreational land that is heavily used by Wake and Durham county residents. Office parks near theairport have a wealth of office space that lies empty. There is a nearly abandoned shopping mall just off Airport Blvd. that needs to be redeveloped. These sites are well within driving distanceof the airport. I just don't see why a commercial developer would take the risk of building on land that is wholly owned by the FAA. It's much wiser for them to put their investments in propertythat could be resold easily.The area near the airport is growing with commercial and residential development. As more people move into the area, having a natural refuge like the parks at LCCP and Umstead becomemore important for quality of life. To destroy them for short-term economic gain shows that the FAA and the RDU Airport Authority care more about profits over people. Please reconsiderdeveloping these recreation areas.

There were noticeable groans at the mention of something like ""all airport land hasto serve an aviation purpose"" or something like that. I guess the trails issue was the #1 idea.What I didn't understand was why the RDUAA cares and controls the small piece of land that the bikers use. My thought was that it's between a County park and a lake, so why does the airportown it? It wasn't until after the presentation, when I was small talking with an older guy from the Board, that he told me that Park itself is on leased land from RDUAA. I didn't know that at all.Maybe most did, but I had no idea. He mentioned that there are ""many"" parks that we think are county parks but are really on leased land.So, now the trails issue makes sense.

203,"The Land Use meeting yesterday (6/28) set the tone for why RDUAA will develop the property that currently situates Lake Crabtree County Park and the property adjacent to it that has beenutilized for mountain biking trails- the reason being FAA regulations. Has anyone spoken to the FAA and asked if these two land parcels can be leased indefinitely to Wake County Parks &Recreation?I don't believe the reasons for ground leases/selling land/land use are legitimate given that BWI airport has a biking path/greenway that goes around the airport (on airport property) and is solelyfor recreation use. So in that case, the FAA is okay with BWI's recreation use of land but RDUAA is trying to tell us it's not ok here in the Triangle? The citizens of Cary, Morrisville, Raleigh,Durham, Wake Forest and surrounding areas are heavy users of the trails and park. By destroying these trails, RDUAA will be responsible for a decline in property values and quality of life inthe Triangle. What is the point of living here and traveling to the Raleigh area if you remove a significant portion of greenspace that over 300,000 people use on yearly basis?I am disappointed that RDUAA did not attempt to work with local and state government to find a solution that would be amenable to both its citizens and airport economic needs. InsteadRDUAA has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on paying consultants who do not live here and who do not care about the repercussions that will be felt well beyond 2040.I do not support RDUAA's land use proposals for these two tracts of land and will be speaking to my senator and will be contacting the FAA to understand what can and cannot be done.",6/29/2016
204,"I appreciate the work you put into the presentation and materials provided last night, and I fully support the idea of having additional nonaeronautical land uses at RDU. However, I would like tosee more emphasis on transportation in your land use plans - how do you anticipate people will come in and out of the airport and access the new land uses you are proposing? I wouldencourage you to place the transit facility close to the terminals where it makes it really easy to take the bus/shuttle/light rail in, thus allowing folks to leave their cars at home. As a regulartransit rider, having to make multiple connections is a big deterrent from taking transit for a trip over driving a car. I would also like to see explicit inclusion of the planned Brier Creek Greenway,which is proposed to run along the western edge of the RDU property. This would provide a critical transportation connection between Brier Creek and Morrisville/Cary, allowing people to biketo work and shopping rather than drive. In addition, having trails around the new land uses would provide recreation options for the employees in the new buildings. Trails such as these do notrequire a lot of maintenance and are low-impact uses that are compatible with the aeronautical and other uses of RDU land. I realize that you're still in the early stages of the master planningprocess, but it is not too early to identify locations of possible greenway connections, just as you have done with airport facilities and land uses.You can see more about the bicycle and pedestrian network in the area around RDU in the CORE Bicycle & Pedestrian Plan, available here: http://www.tjcog.org/core-reports-downloads.aspxThe shapefile data can also be viewed online here: http://arcg.is/2907uvDThank you.",6/29/2016

Can you elaborate on this and explain how the RDUAA has been able to hold largeamounts of undeveloped land for many years and it not be considered ""land banking""?2. It was stated in the presentation last night that any real estate transactions, including ground leases, must be negotiated at market terms, as required by the FAA. The land lease to WakeCounty for Lake Crabtree County Park is not reflective of current market terms. Can you further elaborate on this arrangement and how RDUAA reports these terms to the FAA?3.

I have hiked and biked with friends and family on the Lake Crabtree County Park trails for over 20 years. They were some of the first trails my kids rode when the training wheelscame off their bikes. I implore you to reconsider the destruction of this wonderful park that has been an oasis and home to so many over the past several decades.

209,"Hello. As an avid user of the many wonderful recreational areas in the proposed changes region, I feel it necessary to comment. This area is a great boon for visitors and residents alike with itsvast green space and proximity to a large urban area. In a time of rapid development and loss of highly valuable green space, any further loss will lead to less economic growth in the area asthe attraction to these areas will be greatly diminished. One thing that attracted me and my family to the Raleigh area was the large amount of green space for recreational use. The loss of thevast majority of Lake Crabtree County Park will be a loss, not only for those who actively use those trails, but also for local economic benefits afforded by these uses. Also, removing the bufferareas around Umstead State Park will reduce the quiet nature of the trails inside the park. As with everything, the quiet and green areas will continue to disappear. I, for one, will never use anyof the proposed hotel or retail spaces proposed if either of these parks (LCCP and Umstead) are diminished in the proposed manner as I will have no use to be in the area. I will also considermoving out of this area if this goes through. This goes for many others who currently use these spaces. Please be very aware that the idea that these will increase the money gained from theseareas will not be seen as the attractiveness to these areas will decrease and the loss of these valuable spaces will lead to less migration to and greater migration from the Raleigh-Durhamregion.",6/29/2016

213,"After looking at the 4 alternatives that were shortlisted, Alternative C seems to be a more clean design in terms of efficiency and utility. Extensive additions to Terminal 2 and limiting additions toTerminal 1 would definitely be more convenient for people that might be transiting through the airport. Although, the number of passengers transiting through RDU is not significant at this time,Alternative C definitely positions the airport to be in a better position to handle significantly more transit passengers as air service increases. Also, this alternative makes an ""Internationalconcourse"" a possibility. The extra space at the end of the terminal near the International gates can also be used for something like duty free retail. Concentrating the gates in Terminal 2 wouldalso be a pitching point to attract more and maybe better dining and retail options as it would generate more foot traffic compared to splitting the new gates between the two terminals. Also, inAlternative C most of the gates are on the side of the airport that have two run ways. I think this will reduce airplane traffic moving around the airport on the taxi ways.",6/29/2016
214,"Sorry I wasn't able to attend last nights Workshop.Regarding Airfield Facilities Alternate A would be the most cost effective as it involves extending the two existing runways and adding a third where as the other alternates involve in some wayor another extending one existing runway and adding two new runways. My concern would be interfering with day to day operations as one runway would have to be down in order to extend theother. I assume the plane would be to construct the new runway first and then modify one of the existing runways at a time thereby always having two runways available all the time. Is thatcorrect?Regarding Terminal Facilities again Alternate A would be the most cost effective with minimum impact on terminal 2. I am confused with Alternative B and C as to what is shown on the northend of Terminal 1. That facility is currently under demolition and would be available for terminals in those two alternatives lessening the impact on Terminal 2.Regarding Landside Facilities I am confused why Alternative has a new offsite ground transportation/rental area. The same space is available for use as shown in Alternative B and C. Why notuse it?Regarding General Aviation one of the alternatives had a general aviation runway.

Money will come and go... since RDU Airport owns over 5,000 acres, why wouldeven consider taking the green-space first? Develop the property north of the airport.

The park currently affords thousands a recreational greenspace consistingof single track mountain bike, and hiking/walking trails. Many in the area have no other alternative to such spaces and if eliminated will only devalue the attractiveness of the area. Furthermore,there are a multitude of local bike shops which are dependent on legal access use of trail systems for their customers. Without these trails, surely they will suffer losses, as well tax revenuegenerated from bike sales.Please do not look upon the property as merely what can be gained financially from developing it but what the local population will loose without it.Regards",6/30/2016

I have not spent a lot of time reviewing the plans in detail but wanted to make afew general comments first:1) Passenger Pick up at Terminal 2 needs substantial improvement – especially if adding gates;2) Add a right turn lane for the back exit onto W. International Drive to keep traffic flowing more efficiently; and3) Please consider the addition of Free Wi-Fi (many airports have it now).Regarding the revised plans, I favor expansion on the Terminal 2 side. As an avid supporter of Umstead State Park and our greenways, I strongly oppose any development that moves closer tothe park since you can already hear the airport noise when you are hiking.In reviewing the new plans:• I FAVOR Alternative C which seems to meet the above preferences most closely.• I strongly OPPOSE Alternative D due to the additional runway on the east side that would negatively impact Umstead state park and as a resident off of Ebenezer Church Road, I don’t want tohear additional planes any closer than they already are.• Alternatives A and B would be preferred over D but again, with additional gates and additional aircraft, I suspect additional noise would result on the East Side which I oppose.Thanks again and we hope that consideration of the value of Umstead State Park is a priority.",7/2/2016

234,"In general Alternatives 1,2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are critically flawed and should not be advanced for further consideration. Only Alternatives 3 and 5 (excluding relocated general aviation) meet thestated goals and are the most affordable. Consider the following specific comments1. New runway: Under no circumstances should a new runway be built closer to Umstead State Park as shown in Alternatives 1, 2 and 9. RDU should be a better neighbor to this irreplaceableresource. A new runway needs to be located to the west of 5L-23R. At 14,000 feet in length to accommodate the newest transatlantic jets it will be one of the longest on the east coast.2. Existing Runway 5L-23R: Under no circumstances should it converted to a taxiway as shown in Alternatives 4, 6, 7 and 8. Citizens of Durham and Wake Counties paid dearly for this runway.It was the need for cheap crushed rock to build it that justified a quarry adjacent to Umstead State Park in 1980. Collateral damage after the Federal government prevented a mid 1970’s RDUgrand plan to align its runways into the state park. Runway 5L-23R at 10,000 ft compares to the largest active runways at any major airport on the east coast today. There is no need to converta relatively new, fully functioning runway into a taxiway. There exists considerable space for adding new gates around RDU central parking as shown in Alternatives 2, 4, 5 and 6. Thereplacement cost using Florida DOT transportation costs (Janurary, 2016) has to be considerably more than $1 Billion, very expensive.3. Existing Runway 5R-23L: It has not been declared obsolete. Given the cost of building new runways it is difficult to justify building two new runways at a cost of more than $2 Billion as shownin Alternatives 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8. RDU has to be more cost conscience.4. General Aviation: Why build new, expanded general aviation infrastructure? Is there not a significant safety conflict between expanded general aviation and expanded commercial aviation atsuch a large airport? Relocating it closer to Umstead State Park as shown in Alternatives 3, 4 and 5 is also unacceptable. It seems to me RDU should be discouraging general aviation at RDU.There are outlaying airports with the capacity and need for more general aviation. Cannot RDU coordinate, even finance these airports to meet the needs of general aviation in the RTP region.5. Rental Car Facilities: Remote facilities are the trend, but at RDU there is room for such close-in to the terminals. Visitors will most appreciate a bus ride no longer than the current route.Combining remote parking and rental car returns seems like an obvious choice.6. Terminal T2: Building gate spurs as shown in Alternative 6 will be more disruptive and much more costly than a new terminal in Alternative 2 and 5. Again it means capriciously abandoning5L-23R.7. Future Aviation Related Development in Alternative 2 has too many undefined possibilities to be allowed further inclusion at this time. There is no way to evaluate impacts, benefits or costs.8. Exisiting Runway 14-32: Close it. Traffic from this runway is routed directly over Umstead State Park. If a new runway is built west of 5L-23R, then 5R-23L can be used for general aviation.",7/6/2016

261,Please do not destroy Lake Crabtree Park. It is one of the best mountain biking parks we have in the area and a great park overall. We need more trees and parks. Less office buildings andparking lots. Thank you for your consideration.,7/22/2016
262,I am a mountain biker and live in Youngsville NC. The trails around the airport and that would appear to be removed with this plan is one of the few reasons I travel to Raleigh and RTP. It wouldbe a complete travesty to destroy this incredible resource. I really question if you have the understanding of how important this area is to the health of the general population and the overallimpact if they were removed.,7/22/2016
263,"My friends, coworkers, and I use the land under discussion for development on a weekly, if not daily basis for outdoor recreation. Indeed, these parcels of land together constitute the topreason I love working in Cary and living in this area. I would see their development not as an economic necessity at all, but rather a betrayal. These lands should continue to be a buffer zonebetween the land that was granted to the airport authority and the surrounding businesses and homes. The goodwill, quality of life, and and economic stimulation that they provide as greenspace within the triangle far outstrip the temporary and shortsighted gains that their destruction for commercial uses would.Please consider alternate plans for Crabtree and the parcels to either side of Old Reedy Creek road. I'm sure that the land can be transferred to a trust through grants, municipal and state parkssystems, and private contributors. Every time I drive around the edges of Durham, Chapel Hill, Cary, Morrisville, and Raleigh I see new housing developments, strip malls, and light industryconstruction. This growth makes it only more important that we preserve the existing outdoor recreation that we already have in the urban heart of the triangle, before we homogenize anddestroy the parts that are unique and special in favor of endless repetition for faceless, private use of land that would be better used by the masses.",7/22/2016

Our great quality of life is one of the key selling points for this area, but this planwould undermine that. Having mountain biking trails close to RTP and Cary, where workers can bike at lunch or after work, is a big selling point when recruiting new businesses and improvesour quality of life. This plan would negatively impact:- The Lake Crabtree Mountain Biking trails (it would actually do away with them)- Umstead State Park - having a Rock Quarry and blasting next to the park- The East Coast Greenway - it goes by Lake Crabtree and along Old Reedy Creek Road t Umstead- Cary's new Old Reedy Creek trailhead project.",7/22/2016

These trails are critical aswell since they back up to Umstead State Park, offering a way to ride all terrains in one ride.There is plenty of other space to expand and we certainly don't need any more office complexes in the area.

Unfortunate Umstead park is NOT open to mountain biking on the single track trails.While the Umstead Fire roads are nice for general fitness, they are not mountain bike trails and are not the style of riding that lures so many mountain bikers to this area.

I hike in the park with my dog when I come to Cary tovisit friends every month. The park is an oasis of green habitat, life, and quiet in the midst of the rush of the city. If the park was not there all who enjoy the park would have to drive considerablyfarther for the same beauty and relaxation.

293,"I am a big fan of RDU as an airport. RDU is extremely accessible, clean and efficient. I also support plans to continue modernizing the airport. However, I do wonder if expansion of the airportsize is necessary. In particular, the total number of annual passengers coming through RDU is similar to the same number today as it was 25 years ago in 1990 (https://www.rdu.com/airport-authority/statistics/#year). Why should the next 25 years be any different? For example, a clear shift of American Airline's flights from RDU to CLT may lead to a further decrease in flightnumbers from RDU. I do hope the airport authority moves cautiously over the next few years.Finally, as an avid cyclist, runner and hiker, I can only hope that RDU chooses not to destroy the trails that surround the area by Umstead, Lake Crabtree, 286 and Rocky Road. These trails addtremendous value to the community, and removing them for unnecessary growth or unnecessary office space would be a travesty. Notably, the area already has many airport hotels and aplethora of local options for office/warehouse space, while open green space is at a premium. It is much easier to rebuild an office park than a forest. Finally, I believe going this route woulddestroy much of the goodwill RDU has built up since opening in 1943.Best",7/22/2016

As a mountain biker, I feel that great trails will be lost.I am also concerned that these expansion projects may be extensive given the current spaces available.

354,"Hello, I moved to Cary just over a year ago to pursue my studies at NCSU. One of the unique qualities about Raleigh that brought me to the area was integration between a city and naturallandscaping. There are times when driving through the city that you can almost forgot the city surrounding you underneath the canopy of trees amidst the fields of wildflowers. There arenumerous parks within the city that afford its residents the opportunity to escape and one of these parks that is near and dear to my heart is Lake Crabtree.Lake Crabtree offers a unique combination of canoeing, fishing, hiking, and mountain biking to its visitors. For me personally, the mountain bike trails are the biggest draw. Since I startedmountain biking (2013) I have never seen a trail so well preserved and maintained by group as the ones maintained at Crabtree by the Triangle Off-Road Cyclists (TORC) group. TORC'sdedication to their trail system really serves a pivotal role in making Crabtree a wonderful for the everyday person to escape the city for an afternoon. It would be a shame for the city of Raleighto lose such a valuable piece to its culture and community.The cost of a growing and expanding city is that things must change, land developed, and open spaces lost. However, I think it would be a true tragedy to sacrifice Lake Crabtree for the growthof this expansion. After reviewing the development plans, it appears that Crabtree has been selected for the development of a hotel and this would come at the loss of its mountain bike trails. Itruly hope that an alternative location can be selected for the development of a hotel and that Crabtree can be spared so that future generations may continue to enjoy the beauty it has to offer.",7/25/2016

That said, I am also a mountain biker -- and we haveceded enough of our land to demolition in the past few years. There are no good parks left in the area for riding other than 286, Rocky Road, and Crabtree -- with 286 coming first-and-foremost.They're all important, though, and they're clustered tightly in a way that attracts riders from neighboring cities and counties.It is time to make these trails legal and to protect them. Crabtree -- already legal, of course -- is important for its ability to draw-in new riders and get them outdoors, enjoying Wake County; 286offers the best multi-purpose trail system for miles, and is far superior even to Beaver Dam (a paid trail); Rocky Road offers some of the best tech for a bit of variety, and has immediate accessto the creek system for a beautiful view.Protect these trails. There is nothing left in Cary to ride. Seriously.

363,"Comments to RDU 2040 Master Plan, June 28 AlternativesOnly Alternative A meets the stated goals. Alternative B needlessly abandons the runway 5L-23R and thus requires two new runways. Alternatives C and D are also critically flawed and shouldnot be advanced for further consideration. Consider the following specific comments1. New runway: Under no circumstances should a new runway be built closer to Umstead State Park as shown in Alternative D. RDU should be a better neighbor to this irreplaceable resource.The new runway needs to be located to the west of 5L-23R.2. A quarry on publicly owned land as shown on the June 28 planning maps is unacceptable. Is RDU so desperate for income that it will cannibalize a precious, publicly owned naturalresource? A quarry has to be the lowest and worst possible use of this exceptional tract of riparian forest. There have to be other uses that would benefit the community that RDU serves andalso provide RDU some income. Would this parcel not in the long term be better suited for park and recreational uses? Perhaps there is a way to swap this parcel for another from the parkmore suitable to airport needs. The boundary between RDU and Umstead could be realigned to better serve both park and airport. The master plan should make such cooperation a strongrecommendation.3. That RDU even considered mining the parcel between Umstead State Park and Lake Crabtree Park shows a gross insensitivity to the values Umstead provides to the same region that RDUserves. Perhaps current RDU management does not remember that Wake Stone Quarry bordering Umstead was justified on the grounds that cheap rock was needed to build the RDU 5L-23Rrunway back in the early 1980’s over strong objections of park supporters. This June 28 plan unnecessarily opens old wounds. Did RDU even consider its impacts to the park as part of themaster planning process? RDU and Umstead should have a formal agreement recognizing the values each brings to the region and at a minimum commit to limit impacts to each other. Themaster plan should make such agreement a strong recommendation.4. Finally, introducing the quarry at the last stage of the master planning process undermines the integrity of the entire master planning process.

370,"First, I appreciate and recognize the economic value of continued development of RDU airport. It is a critical link between the triangle and the rest of the world and continued modernization ofRDU is so important in representing what our region is all about; a nice place to visit, a great place to live and work. The redevelopment of terminal two has been a shining example...it is truly abeautiful facility and makes my home airport a pleasure to fly out of. And I'm excited by the continued work on terminal 1 as well. Keep up the good work!Part of what makes the triangle a great place to live and work has been our commitment to green space. Unfortunately, as the area has grown our commitment to green space and recreationareas is wavering, which in turn is lowering property values and reducing our quality of life.Lake Crabtree park, and those portions of the airport authority land that directly adjoin with Umstead State Park (those parcels west of the quary and east of the Aviation Parkway exit to I-40),are prime examples of green space/recreation areas that need to be protected. While the airport authority has a responsibility to develop RDU airport to keep pace with the growth of ourcommunity, it also has a responsibility (as do we all) to help ensure that this growth is manged to ensure that we don't lose sight of the fact that our area is so popular because of ourcommitment to our citizens and the quality of their lives.I beg of you, keep those parcels of land green. Donate those small parcels north of I-40 to the State so that it can become part of Umstead State Park; it's a natural fit to the current land use ofthe area. Donate Lake Crabtree park to the county with the caveat that it remain a park for visitors to and citizens of our area to enjoy. It's these investments in the quality of life of our area thatmade me move my family here to the triangle over 20 years ago.

410,"I attended the last public information session at the Airport Authority regarding the future of the RDU land. I wanted to provide my comments.I am a 47 year old woman that works in RTP. I regularly like to visit Crabtree for mountain biking, typically alone, partly because of convenience, but mostly because it is a safe environment forme. As a woman, being alone in the woods can be a pretty scary thing. Crabtree has the advantage of being one of the more visited Wake County parks, with plenty of bike and foot traffic. Assuch, when I am at Crabtree, I never worry about being isolated and at risk. Further, mountain biking does include an element of danger and if I were to fall, I know that someone will comealong shortly and help.Previously, I was involved with Trips for Kids-Triangle and we regularly brought at-risk kids out to Crabtree to mountain bike. It is an ideal location for people of all skills to mountain bike. Theyalways had an amazing experience. Given the proximity to so many children, Crabtree is ideally suited for similar mountain biking trips in the future. Driving out to the other parks, such as Harrisand Beaverdam, takes more time and there is less variety for kids.I noticed in the last public hearing that the real thrust of the final decision will be about money. My question is, what price does the Airport Authority put on the safety and well-being of womenwho enjoy the outdoors? There are so few places that we can go alone without worrying about our safety. Further, Crabtree's central location to a growing metropolis is important. As theTriangle region continues to expand, less green space will be available for use by a much larger population. There is already this lovely green space that suddenly you want to parcel out so thatpeople with money can make even more money. I understand that the Airport Authority has to consider it's growing needs, and how to fund them, but won't the growing population that will beusing the airport fund the growing airport? Why is there suddenly a need to cut down all of the trees and build more offices and hotels?Thank you for your consideration.",7/27/2016
411,"Lake Crabtree County Park and it's trails are a precious resource to our area. I'm not sure how RDU would even consider leasing and developing the lands that make up the park and trail. If thepark and trail were not\under utilized I'd understand but this park is well used and loved.Everyday myself and several other hundreds of thousands of people in the Raleigh- Durham - Chapel Hill area make the trek along I-40 /540/147 to get to work or home. Schedules are hectic,time is limited, and for quite a few people have access to the LCCP is a saving grace. Countless times I've been short on time but was still able to get to LCCP for a short run/bike. Or the times Ipick the kids up from daycare and rather than sit in the parking lot called I-40, we run around for hour and enjoy the green space.RDU, please be a good neighbor... listen to the community. We don't want this area developed. Lake Crabtree County Park should be preserved, it's an asset!",7/27/2016

These trails, if marketed properly, which they are not, could be a catalyst to drive more and moreadventures to this area., many of which will come back, and possibly make roots in our fabulous community. Another benefit of keeping the trails, is keeping an area for our local community tostay healthy and fit, in a family friendly environment, that is central to RDU. To take this away would be a blow to a lot of the values that we families hold dear in the Triangle.",7/27/2016
414,"The Crabtree / Umstead trail system is an absolute jewel in the crown of the Triangle's open spaces - it's heavily used by runners, dog walkers, trail walkers, mountain bikers, cyclocross riders,kids, adults and families. It would be a travesty to consider turning any of this important land into offices and quarries merely to generate revenue for the airport. That is not an essential need forthe airport - it's an airport; not a property company.",7/27/2016
415,"It would ultimately behoove RDU to preserve greenspace and wooded land for use by the community. There is significant revenue potential if the land is preserved. It will take only slightly morecreativity than feeding the land to developers. Natural spaces attract affluent outdoorsy types who enjoy recreation and consider it part of their identity. These folks are often more than ready tospend dollars on retail items related to outdoor recreation, food, and alcohol. If natural space is preserved, business opportunity will present itself. Furthermore, should the volume and quality ofwalking and bike trails increase at the rate it is now, the area in question will be on its way to earning a reputation as destination worthy. Please reconsider plans to destroy some of the bestutilized and ecologically significant land in the Triangle metro area. Our children will be grateful.",7/27/2016
416,"I am submitting this comment with regard to the Lake Crabtree County Park (LCCP) and Old Reedy Creek (ORC) trail systems. I am a Raleigh resident and Wake County tax payer. I would notbe exaggerating to say that I partake in mountain biking or hiking on the LCCP and ORC trail systems on average 3-5 times per week. Riding and walking these trails adds quality of life that Ihave come to rely on for pleasure and health. Not only do my family and I partake in using these trails, but I also ride quite often with a dozen or so friends.One of the great things about living in the Triangle is the valuable resources we have for hiking and biking and LCCP and ORC are the heart and soul of those trail systems.It would be greatly disappointing to lose those trails and it would reduce the quality of living and health for a large percentage of the population who live in and around the Triangle.I implore you to reconsider leasing this land for commercial use thus resulting in the loss of these heavily used trail systems.Sincerely",7/27/2016

If RDU proceeds with converting the current park into office spaces, it might very well find that (as we used to say in the Army) you might very well win the battlebut lose the war.

435,"As a Councilman for nearby Clayton (2004-2012) I would like to draw an analogy to your predicament at the Airport Authority with its master plan. ---Parks are in the top three selling points forpeople looking to live in and around Clayton. Several developments were halted during the real estate decline in 2008. It's back now, however Clayton has East Clayton Park; dog park; and theformer YMCA land is now a multi field soccer complex. This adds to the already four plus parks for tennis, mountain biking, greenway, volleyball, you get the point.So what does this have to do with Crabtree Park and Adjacent areas to Umstead such as 286 and Rocky Knob trail systems? Everything! Thousands of people go to these parks everyday fromwithin and outside of Wake County! This brings revenue, and positive economic impact to this unspoiled area in the heart of Wake County. If the Airport land is developed I guarantee peoplewill seek out other counties in North Carolina to spend outdoor time and activities. Rumors will start about the lack of park space for varying activities unique to this area such as mountainbiking. Even Clayton has Legend Park, which alone attracts people to Clayton from all over the area.I ask that you consider the values of this unspoiled land at Crabtree Park and Umstead, and its importance to Wake County and the Airport Authority to maintain it in its current condition.If you have any questions please feel free to call me at...",7/27/2016

Everyone appreciates what RDU has managed to keep at bay.There aren't many airports with a view like the one RDU has to boast about. There aren't many airports that can display the autumn colors of Umstead's deciduous forest to incoming visitors.There aren't many airports that can display the gray and haunting architecture of naked trees. There aren't many airports that can display the spring green renewal of emerging leaves.

However, I wouldencourage thinking about a perimeter corridor trail that could incorporate mountain biking and opportunities for connectivity of trail systems, especially if the Lake Crabtree Park is transitionedinto more buildings without consideration of the existing trail system. (Although a hotel or office in a park setting would be especially appealing if planned and designed to be just that) Most ofthe perimeter of the airport appears to be open to the public in terms of land use or lacks a land use designation at this time.

I've been at the airport for 20 years working I've seen the expansion over the years it's not all about the money althoughyou folks seem to believe it is this airport should be a crown jewel other communities in other states to model after if we do it smartly there's no reason to destroy the environment surroundingthe airport just for commerce,7/28/2016

The forested areas marked for development include land directly adjacent to Umstead State Park andmuch of the land within Lake Crabtree County Park, the most heavily used park in the Wake County Park system. These lands have approximately 32 miles of existing recreational trails built bylocal residents and are used by mountain bikers, walkers, and runners. Users include Wake, Durham and Orange county residents who work in RTP or live in close proximity to the park.

The now defunct Airport Mall sits mostly vacant just across I-40 from the airport on Airport Blvd. There are several un-used or under-used commercial sites proximal to the airport.The destruction of coveted forest land to build more, while existing spaces sit vacant, is ludicrous.I urge the airport authority to seek a more sensible solution and preserve existing natural, park and greenway space for local residents, taxpayers and clients of the RDU airport.Thank you",7/28/2016

483,"Dear Attn: Master Plan StudyI have lived in North Carolina for 25 years, fresh out of college moved down with my job at IBM/RTP. The reason I loved NC was because of all the green space, bike trials, parks and gorgeousweather. Through the years I have seen more and more forested green space torn down and buildings built up while at the same time older buildings becoming vacant. This makes no sense!!!For example the Morrisville Outlet mall - years ago that was the only place to go for lunch and now it's down to just a few stores. Why not tear that down and rebuild there?Developing buildings over Crabtree park will be a disservice to everyone - the traffic on Aviation Blvd is already at max capacity in the mornings and evenings. Are you planning to make that a 4lane road? The only way to do that is to widen it into the lake but I see a lot of local people fish there because it's easy access. Making it wider or adding more buildings will equal more trafficand be more dangerous and not benefit local residents.Then there are the environmental effects, as more and more land is trampled over where do you expect the wildlife to go, they are all ready jammed up in our backyards in Cary, with Foxes,Deer, etc. And then there is the watershed issue, Crabtree lake and creek already flood with a heavy rain, Evans road flooded out last week with that heavy rain. If Crabtree park is buildings vsland and trees, the water will have no where to go and the flooding will be worse!Lastly the proximity of this forested recreation space to the urban area only increases property values and positively affects the quality of life in the Triangle region. This benefits not only existingresidents, but also helps to attract future businesses and employees.From what I've read this is all to generate revenue, and I believe there are far better alternatives available than the destruction of yet another forested recreation space.Thank you for the reading my letter and I hope you will consider alternatives.",7/28/2016

486,"I was not able to attend the latest public workshop on June 28 but wanted to provide feedback on the material that was presented online.It appears you have presented 4 options for land use development for airport services. I'd like to voice strong opposition against 'Alternative A'. I'd like to voice my concern for the potentialdestruction and commercial development of the existing green spaces, trails and park areas near route 40 as shown in the ""Potential Land Use Concepts” chart.Umstead & Crabtree Park and the surrounding areas are a gem to a large and growing number of residents, hikers and outdoor sport enthusiasts. Although there are a number of small parkareas and green spaces around Cary, nothing comes close what Umstead Park, Crabtree Park and the the Crabtree Creek and the surrounding area provides for runners, bikers, hikers andfamilies due to the vast trail network, proximity to both residential and business areas of Cary (which allow people to enjoy exercise and outdoor activities as well as a respite during off-hours atwork) and accessibility through greenways and roads.I personally utilize this area at least 2-3 times a week and have seen a growing number of people using the area trails year after year. I am an avid trail biker and there are very few options fortrail riding in and around Cary, and the existing trails in this area attract trail riders and runners from all over the region. I have seen attendance and utilization of this area grow significantly yearafter year and interest continues to grow.Green spaces have a value that is often overlooked or missing from spreadsheets and accounting books. Not only do green spaces provide a space for recreation, these spaces also provide apublic benefit in the form of mental and physical health. Additionally, Umstead Park and respect for nature parks and spaces is part of what makes the Cary area a desirable place to live. Thisvalue is indirectly reflected in the property values and businesses in the area. (What is New York without Central Park? Or Washington DC without Rock Creek Park?)Industrial use or the destruction of trails to build another hotel or industrial area (there are many other areas close by that could serve that purpose) eliminates or diminishes the health andcommunity benefits for many for the benefit of fewer individuals. The tradeoff in this case is not comparable nor is it worth the price.You have an obligation to make sure that the needs of the RDU airport are met for many years to come. You also have the opportunity to make choices that will impact residents for many yearsdown the road. Industrial or Commercial development in RDU areas will only limit possible expansion in the future and add to traffic and transportation headaches, and will eliminate a fantasticgreen space that is becoming increasingly important to residents.Looking at the other Alternatives, it appears you have the opportunity to make decisions that support both the needs of the airport and the preserves existing green spaces and trails. I hope youmake the right choice.Thanks for listening.",7/28/2016
487,"Hello,I feel compelled to write and express my strong disapproval at the thought of developing any of the land currently included in Lake Crabtree park. This park is the only multi-use nature park inthe central area of Wake County that is reasonably accessible to I-40. No other park that isn't on the outskirts of Wake County has the full scope of activities available at Lake Crabtree. It's alsoclearly one of, if not the most used park in the Triangle area, by a wide variety of people in many different ways. I'd suggest you strongly consider alternate metrics when evaluating the value ofthis land, such as quality of life, and residential access to natural areas. Our area's children do not, and will never need to see more hotels and offices, but they do, and will always need easyaccess to parks and recreation.The Airport Authority still has a huge amount of land available to develop on the north side of I-40. With good planning and vision(!), it should be able to create additional revenue sources onthat side as needed. Developing Lake Crabtree would be a shortsighted money grab that would leave us all poorer in the long run.I'm a 25-year resident of this area, and I love living here, but we've already lost way too much of our natural areas to development. If we continue to lose them, I can't see spending the rest ofmy days here. I doubt that I'm alone in that way of thinking. Other towns and cities in NC and around the country have been able to find a good balance between development andnatural/recreational areas- I hope we can do the same here.Thank you for your consideration.",7/28/2016

As we kept coming back with the intention to ""look around"" the greens turn to ocher,yellow, orange, reds. We starter hiking in between real state appointments fell in love right away. I have been here for 10 years now and I can't believe that you are blind to the real value ofLCCP and the surrounding ORC green space. This will be just another city, just another airport.

489,"Regarding the property currently being used by Wake County for Lake Crabtree County Park, I request that the Airport Authority work collaboratively with Wake County, Triangle Off-RoadCyclists, and other conservation, academic, and community development organizations to protect this high value natural and recreational resource. The proposed idea of creating an Urban TrailCenter is one alternative that would provide a wider and greater array of public benefits, and likely economic benefits, than the short term and limited benefits of typical commercial/office and/orhotel development. There are likely many ways to craft such a center, with finance models that could greater benefit RDU in the long term, as well as boosting the reputation of RDU, and theTriangle as being a fabulous place to work and visit.I purchased my first home at 284 Beechtree Drive in Cary for the express purpose of it's location nearby to the Lake Crabtree Park Trails, Black Creek Greenway, and Umstead Park. Manystudies show that housing values are higher nearby conserved lands- this may not benefit RDU directly, but does benefit the community beyond short term profits found with typicaldevelopment that can be located on any parcel. I'm happy to share these if desired.To summarize, conserving and highlighting the forested land adjacent to Lake Crabtree, and the recreational opportunities within, provide a tremendous value (and opportunity) for theimmediate and regional community, and I'd propose, a chance for RDU to make itself a lauded national leader in sustainable community development.

509,"I'm 100% in agreement with the following from one of the triangle's best organizations:Triangle Off-Road Cyclists (TORC) (www.torc-nc.org) is a 501-(c)(3) organization dedicated to ensuring the future of mountain biking in the Triangle area. At the June 28th Public Workshop #7the Airportâ€™s land use plan was unveiled. This plan slates several naturally forested areas for commercial development and this development would result in the destruction of irreplaceable,centrally-located forested recreation areas and trails. The forested areas marked for development include land directly adjacent to Umstead State Park and much of the land within LakeCrabtree County Park, the most heavily used park in the Wake County Park system. These lands have approximately 32 miles of existing recreational trails built by local residents and are usedby mountain bikers, walkers, and runnersâ€¦both adults and childrenâ€¦groups and individuals. Some of the trails in this forested green space offer beginner/kid-friendly mountain biking andthus foster family outdoor recreation. Also, these trails are connected to the greenway systems of both Raleigh and Cary.In addition to the loss of forested recreation space, development of these lands would remove an important green space buffer between the airport facilities and the very popular Umstead StatePark and could negatively affect the hundreds of acres within the Crabtree Creek watershed.The Airportâ€™s master planning process revealed that none of these lands are required for runways, terminals, parking, or any other facility directly related to passengers or aircraft at theRDU facility. The planners propose to use these lands for the sole purpose of generating revenue for the airport by leasing these lands out to developers to build office space, hotels, and aquarry. For all of these revenue-generating items, alternatives are available, so the destruction of forested recreation space and forested green space buffer to Umstead need not occur.Triangle Off-Road Cyclists urges the preservation of all the existing forested lands, trails, and green space within the Airport Authorityâ€™s project area which is located to the South and Eastof National Guard Drive and Aviation Parkway. We further suggest that the Airport work with surrounding municipalities to investigate the creation of an Urban Trails Center within this property.This Urban Trails Center would create business opportunities for new and existing hotels, campgrounds, restaurants, bars, bike shops, and recreation outfitters.The proximity of this forested recreation space to the urban area only increases property values and positively affects the quality of life in the Triangle region. This benefits not only existingresidents, but also helps to attract future businesses and employees. The Triangle region should look at the work which has taken place in Richmond, VA, and Chattanooga, TN to preservetrails close to population centers. Triangle Off-Road Cyclists strongly believe that the benefits from an Urban Trail Center to the community far outweigh any benefits to the community whichmight be realized by creating a few new offices, a hotel, and a quarry. Triangle Off-Road Cyclists recognize that RDU Airport is important to our area and has funding challenges it mustovercome, however, we believe an Urban Trail Center is a far better solution to the community than the land uses proposed by the Airportâ€™s plan. By working with the surroundingmunicipalities, Triangle Off-Road Cyclists firmly believe that we can craft a solution that not only brings necessary revenue to the airport, but also enhances the communities which the airportserves.",7/28/2016
510,"My family flies many times a year and we love the improvements to terminals and RDU is our favorite airport in the country.I've lived all over the country including Hawaii and Santa Barbara, CA and have traveled all around the US and there is no place I'd rather live and call home, than Chapel Hill, NC. Two mainreasons are the weather and number of outdoor activities. Although I don't live that close to Lake Crabtree County Park I've done numerous things there including: adventure racing, mountainbiking, boating, photography, and picnics.Looking at the latest ALP, it's looks like the majority of the park is going to be replaced with office/hotel/recreation. My concern is that the recreation portion is going to get left out and we'll losea major resource to this area and a big reason why many people choose to live here.Do you have any more information about the exact use and office/hotel/recreation seems pretty broad?Thank you very much",7/28/2016
511,"I must object to the RDU Authority's plans to develop the land under its control for financial gain. I don't know the details, but it seems that the Authority should be the steward of the land andreserve it until needed by the airport itself, and should rely on the airport for financial support. Also, the proposal of a quarry in the area seems absolutely incredible; this is a heavily populatedarea visited by many people from the US and different countries. One of their first sights landing at RDU will be a tremendous hole in the ground. I speak from experience, having grown up in ILnear quarries, which generate a lot of heavy truck traffic and are plain unattractive. No amount of fencing can hide them, especially as they age and the fencing falls into disrepair. Also, fly intoChicago and depending on the route, you can see these tremendous scars. I really feel that the Authority seems to be doing something that will be regretted for years to come.",7/28/2016
512,"Please take action to amend the plans to bulldoze the hiking/biking trails near the Reedy Creek area of Umstead Park. As an avid Raleigh mountain biker, I visit these trails at least once aweek.

538,"I live in Greenville, NC about 1 hour, 40 minutes away from Lake Crabtree County Park (LCCP). Any time I am traveling to Raleigh or through Raleigh, I always try to make a stop at LCCP toride my bike. If my sons, age 7 & 10 are with me, I will take them to the trails as well. My wife enjoys just sitting by the lake and reading while we ride. A lot of other trails are too hard for my kidsto ride and LCCP has really gotten them excited about the sport of mountain biking. We always stop for drinks prior to the ride and eat lunch at a nearby restaurant after the ride. Often my wifedrags us all shopping afterwards. So our trips to the area are good for local businesses. Without the park we would have no reason to stop in this area.Last year, I picked up a work colleague from the airport and we went directly to the LCCP trails to mountain bike. He was in town for a 2 day conference and flew in a day early just to mountainbike in the area. Again this was revenue for the area for extra hotels, meals, etc.The loss of these trails would be a loss to the city of Raleigh as a whole. The city is growing rapidly and more and more green space is being lost. NC has been behind the times in viewinggreen space and parks as an asset to healthy urban life.

542,I am writing to express my opposition to the elimination of the Lake Crabtree County Park by the RDU Airport Authority in order to develop this land for related airport services and businesses.This park is an ideal example of an urban park that gets used by numerous groups for convenient outdoor recreation. The idea that this would be eliminated so that development can take overthis land is very depressing. There are surely ways for development to happen while allowing the land the park occupies to be maintained in its current state so that it continues to enrich thelives of those that live nearby. There are also many individuals that drive into the area to use this park and even commute through RDU and take the opportunity to use the park as they areclose by. As the park can draw recreation users from a significant distance it also enhances the tourist population who further benefit the local economy (I am one of these users). I wouldencourage the Authority to consider alternate development plans that do not eliminate this land but instead ensure its continued protection for years to come.,8/1/2016

I have reallyenjoyed biking on this property over the years and look forward to taking my children there when they are old enough. Clearing these areas for development would deprive RDU of this fantastic,centrally located recreational facility that helps promote healthy, active lifestyles in RDU's residents.

I am a Raleigh citizen who frequently uses both Umstead and the LakeCrabtree Park and the plan to develop the forested land near both parks is very disturbing. One of the highlights of the RTP area is the large number of trails and beautiful green spaces that weare able to enjoy, whether we are runners, bikers or simply out for a walk. Developing these lands would remove a valuable resource in the form of a wonderful location for recreation. Theproposed plan is quite frankly a terrible idea.

We value yourfeedback and it will be considered as the master plan study continues.Weâ€™ve received many comments about our parcels of land in the Lake Crabtree County Park area, and weâ€™d like to clarify a few things about use of that land.

Our owning bodies decided years ago that Airport land must support aviation, and agreements with the federal government are in place to thatend.We desire to work with the community on the future use of our land in the Lake Crabtree area.

This lease continues until June 2025. Our leasewith Wake County includes the understanding that at some point, portions of the land may need to be returned to support airport needs.

602,"Folks, I have some suggestions and comments regarding undeveloped land and use of that land for recreational purposes. I understand that eventually much of the undeveloped land could endup being developed and that the FAA restrictions and obligations in some ways force your hand.I also understand that not all of the land is going to be developed right away. In particular I am speaking about the parcels:- between park and ride 3, the National Gurad rd., Old Reedy Creek and Umstead.- the parcel across from the Sheets abutting I40 and Aviation.- other parcels abutting National Guard Rd.While this land is not developed I suggest you embrace its recreational use with the understanding that, that use could be terminated. Consider please1) Working with Umstead to develop an corridor trail from the Sheets / National Gurard rd. area over to Reedy Creek Rd. in Umstead.2) Develop a parcel near the Sheets with recreational, particularly biking, use in mind. Bring in a local bike shop with parking, cleaning stations, outdoor showers to encourage and supportrecreational use of the land and access to Umstead.3) Bring in a bar /restaurant that caters to these recreational users. ( A brew pub would be just the thing. Maybe you could lure Aviation Brewing up from Fuquay)4) Bring in a hotel or encourage an existing hotel adjacent to this area to encourage and support biking with storage, cleaning, and other facilities for bikers.3) Embrace the existing recreational use by mtn bikers, hikers, etc.. on land where those activities are currently trespassing. Work with Umstead, Lake Crabtree, TORC and other interestedparties to fully sanction use of this land for biking, walking etc. while it is not developed.4) Work with TORC, Crabtree, Umstead and other interested parties to develop new trails on currently undeveloped land.Implementing these suggestion could turn the corner near the Sheets into a recreational hub with sufficient commercial activity to justify the existence of land for recreational purposes.Again I understand that the undeveloped land may eventually end up being developed, but while it is not, please work with the recreation community to use it for recreation.Additionally when considering that value of land and its potential development be sure and include in that assessment the existing natural value and ecosystem services that the land provides.Please see: http://www.fs.fed.us/ecosystemservices/ and many other resources available on ecosystem services. With that in mind perhaps some of the land has sufficient value in and of itselfand does not need development.Thank you very much for your consideration.Sincerely,",8/2/2016

Shame on the airport authority for even thinking thatthe best path forward would be to bulldoze and build.

The Airport Authority didn't care about community views in the 1970s when they threatenedeminent domain and they don't care today when they've decided they wish to commercialize the area. The Airport Authority has proven to be a callous and uncaring neighbor. The currentresponse to my initial comments on your Facebook page just further proves this to be true.",8/2/2016

619,"Hi everyone, I wanted to offer some thoughts.... I moved back to the area in the mid-90's for a job opportunity. I discovered the wonders of Lake Crabtree County Park and spent the next fewyears enjoying the Park--the lake , the recreation areas and especially the trail system for hiking and biking. I then relocated out of state for work for some time. I always looked back fondly onthe triangle area with its terrific quality of life and close in access to such wonderful resources. Seven years ago at another career crossroads I moved back to the area. This time it was with mywife and two young children. We chose our new home location based on schools, access to Raleigh/Cary AND access to the Lake Crabtree forested areas. I can't tell you how excited I was/amto call Lake Crabtree my ""home park"" for biking/hiking and other activities. Our first family hiking experience was at Lake Crabtree. Soon after our two children learned to ride their bikes wewere out on the trails at Lake Crabtree in a new way. We took it slow but a couple of years later I am so amazed at the their abilities, their excitement, their fitness, their pride and sense ofaccomplishment. We are at the park nearly every weekend and sometimes during the week. My peers are amazed that my children constantly ask to go to Lake Crabtree and play overspending time on electronic devices/video games. Lastly, part of living in the triangle is the excitement of being part of a dynamic and growing economic fabric that continues to bring new thingsto the area. The RDU airport must continue to grow with the needs of the region otherwise the commerce and other opportunities that make our area great will begin to languish. I've reviewedthe published options and tracts of available land and there seem to be available opportunity for expansion to meet the demand of the airport without destroying some of our most valuableassets (like the forested areas/recreational trail systems). I know the Master Plan Study/RDU-AA will be carefully considering all of these things and will strike the right balance of growth whilepreserving quality of life for residents/stakeholders in the area. Take care",8/3/2016

621,"The potential sale/development of the leased property know by many as Crabtree Park is a short-sighted approach that would remove a valuable natural resource and public space from publicaccess forever. The economic gain, purportedly to support the larger financial program of RDU Airport, does not accurately value the public resource that is being managed in a long-term,sustainable fashion. Once it is gone, the region will forever be poorer in the long run.From a process perspective, I have spent the latter part of my career in civic engagement with a goal to be inclusive, equitably address the full spectrum of interests, and be fully transparent inhow, and if, public participation influences the outcome of planning processes. Your approach has been blatantly old school, just share the facts, don't overpublicize the opportunity for input,and keep your cards close to the chest. Enough of the clichÃ©s, I challenge you to publish the full gamut of public comments you have received, in particular on this one high impact land usedecision.If this is a financial exercise to address FHA requirements, then state that. If it is the planning team's, and ultimately the RDU Authority's intent to take the site out of the public domain, thenstate that.

At the June 28th Public Workshop #7the Airportâ€™s land use plan was unveiled. This plan slates several naturally forested areas for commercial development and this development would result in the destruction of irreplaceable,centrally-located forested recreation areas and trails. The forested areas marked for development include land directly adjacent to Umstead State Park and much of the land within LakeCrabtree County Park, the most heavily used park in the Wake County Park system. These lands have approximately 32 miles of existing recreational trails built by local residents and are usedby mountain bikers, walkers, and runnersâ€¦both adults and childrenâ€¦groups and individuals. Some of the trails in this forested green space offer beginner/kid-friendly mountain biking andthus foster family outdoor recreation. Also, these trails are connected to the greenway systems of both Raleigh and Cary.In addition to the loss of forested recreation space, development of these lands would remove an important green space buffer between the airport facilities and the very popular Umstead StatePark and could negatively affect the hundreds of acres within the Crabtree Creek watershed.The Airportâ€™s master planning process revealed that none of these lands are required for runways, terminals, parking, or any other facility directly related to passengers or aircraft at theRDU facility. The planners propose to use these lands for the sole purpose of generating revenue for the airport by leasing these lands out to developers to build office space, hotels, and aquarry. For all of these revenue-generating items, alternatives are available, so the destruction of forested recreation space and forested green space buffer to Umstead need not occur.Triangle Off-Road Cyclists urges the preservation of all the existing forested lands, trails, and green space within the Airport Authorityâ€™s project area which is located to the South and Eastof National Guard Drive and Aviation Parkway. We further suggest that the Airport work with surrounding municipalities to investigate the creation of an Urban Trails Center within this property.This Urban Trails Center would create business opportunities for new and existing hotels, campgrounds, restaurants, bars, bike shops, and recreation outfitters.The proximity of this forested recreation space to the urban area only increases property values and positively affects the quality of life in the Triangle region. This benefits not only existingresidents, but also helps to attract future businesses and employees. The Triangle region should look at the work which has taken place in Richmond, VA, and Chattanooga, TN to preservetrails close to population centers. Triangle Off-Road Cyclists strongly believe that the benefits from an Urban Trail Center to the community far outweigh any benefits to the community whichmight be realized by creating a few new offices, a hotel, and a quarry. Triangle Off-Road Cyclists recognize that RDU Airport is important to our area and has funding challenges it mustovercome, however, we believe an Urban Trail Center is a far better solution to the community than the land uses proposed by the Airportâ€™s plan. By working with the surroundingmunicipalities, Triangle Off-Road Cyclists firmly believe that we can craft a solution that not only brings necessary revenue to the airport, but also enhances the communities which the airportserves.

Nor does the FAA permitthe airport to establish fees that exceed airfield costs. The self-sustainability obligation is not parcel specific, but rather applies to the entirety of the airport.RDU has not made the case that mining of Parcel 4, â€oeRocky Knobâ€•, is justifiable in the context of the self-sustainable obligation of the entire airport.

FAA Order 5190.6B, Chapter 3 indeed haslanguage stating â€oeproperty may not be leased or rented at a discount or for nominal consideration to subsidize non-airport objectivesâ€• as shown on a slide. HOWEVER, RECREATIONUSE IS an EXCPTION. The language of FAA Order 5190.6B, Chapter 3 FAAâ€™s explicitly references Policy and Procedures Concerning the Use of Airport Revenue, 64 Fed. Reg. 7696,February 16, 1999 (Revenue Use Policy) that includes the following at section VII 6 D:D. Providing Property for Public Community PurposesMaking airport property available at less than fair market rental value for public recreational and other community uses, for the purpose of maintaining positive airport-community relations, canbe a legitimate function of an airport proprietor in operating the airport. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, providing airport land for such purposes will not be considered a violation of theself- sustaining requirement. Generally, the circumstances in which below-market use of airport land for community purposes will be considered consistent with the grant assurances are:1. The contribution of the airport property enhances public acceptance of the airport in a community in the immediate area of the airport; the property is put to a general public use desired bythe local community; and the public use does not adversely affect the capacity, security, safety or operations of the airport. Examples of acceptable uses include public parks, recreationfacilities, and bike or jogging paths. Examples of uses that would not be eligible are road maintenance equipment storage; and police, fire department, and other government facilities if they donot directly support the operation of the airport.2. The property involved would not reasonably be expected to produce more than de minimis revenue at the time the community use is contemplated, and the property is not reasonablyexpected to be used by an aeronautical tenant or otherwise be needed for airport operations in the foreseeable future. When airport property reasonably may be expected to earn more thanminimal revenue, it still may be used for community purposes at less than FMV if the revenue earned from the community use approximates the revenue that could otherwise be generated,provided that the other provisions of VII. D. are met.3. The community use does not preclude reuse of the property for airport purposes if, in the opinion of the airport sponsor, such reuse will provide greater benefits to the airport thancontinuation of the community use.4. Airport revenue is not to be used to support the capital or operating costs associated with the community use.I believe that recreational use of Parcels 1, 2, 3 and 4 shown on your August 2, 2016 update fully qualify for recreational use under FAA rules.",8/8/2016

FAA recommends the airport sponsor/consultant to prepare an â€oeoverview of environmentally sensitive features of an airportâ€• as part of the airportmaster plan. â€¨The overview should also include easily seen and/or readily documented environmental features and resources beyond the airport property line. For RDU the Umstead StatePark should be identified for 49 USC Section 303(c) considerations. On at least two prior RDU actions 49 USC Section 303(c), has been invoked because of adverse impacts to Umstead.In addition the NEPA statute and CEQ regulations require all Federal agencies to integrate the NEPA process with other planning at the earliest possible time.Master planning documentation on the website does not address environmental factors nor NEPA. RDU should identify and document key environmental issues that were involved in analyzingairport development alternatives. Impacts that RDU airport staff needs to consider include those to William B.

Green space preservation is what makes a city desirable,beautiful and fun. Office parks and ""development"" as you call it only serve to pave over the things that make living worthwhile.

710,"While I have always had a pleasant experience inside the airport when flying, I've come to realize that the organization is a corrupt detriment to the community. Their forthcoming plan to""develop"" the land around Crabtree Lake and Umstead park is criminally irresponsible. This airport is not only destroying one of the most popular parks in the city that is used by thousands ofpeople, they are also creating an ecological disaster and encroaching on state wilderness area. Simply put they are destroying some of the little green space left in this part of the community forno other purpose than lining their pockets. The corruption in this act is obvious as 5 of the 7 members of the board of directors are personally invested in land development. While this should bestopped as a conflict of interest it is allowed so that a precious few people can profit at the community's loss. If this was not bad enough, the way in which the airport public relations office hasdealt with the public has been nothing short of condescending and demeaning. A quick example of this is in every precious review where the automatic response is simply ""take a closer look atour land use plan."" This is an obvious dismissal of local concerns instead of an actual response. Furthermore if you read the land use policy you will notice that their justification for destroyingthis land is simply that their lease says they can. No consideration of the community or moral principles. The actions and the attitude of the airport authority reflect their lack of ethics, low moralcharacter, and rampant greed. I urge anyone reading this review to fly from Charlotte instead of Raleigh. Not because the airport functions poorly, but because the organization itself is thepicture of corruption, greed, and irresponsibility. If the airport authority and their public relations department had even a shred of dignity, courage, or common decency they would find a differentway to meet their goals without permanently destroying valuable community property that can never be regained once lost. In summation, the airport authority, their board of directors, and theconsultants that developed this land use plan are corrupt, reckless, irresponsible, greedy, cowardly detriments to this community.",8/14/2016

717,"On behalf of the Park Advisory Committee for William B. Umstead State Park, I am submitting our group comments about the RDU 2040 Vision Plan._________________________________________The Park Advisory Committee of William B. Umstead State Park is writing you about our concerns and suggestions regarding the current RDU Airport’s Vision 2040 Master Planning contentand process.The PAC supports the evaluation of an Urban Recreation Center on RDU property along Old Reedy Creek Rd to protect the recreational and forested quality of this corridor. This UrbanRecreation Center should have its main access off of Aviation Parkway and contain approximately 30-50 miles of trails focusing on single track mountain bike trails and pedestrian trails within aforested corridor connecting to William B. Umstead State Park and Lake Crabtree County Park.There are many examples of such recreational centers that create economic benefits for the region and for adjacent airport. The International Mountain Biking Association (IMBA) recognizesRide Centers with gold, silver, and bronze ratings. There are many examples of these all over the world: https://www.imba.com/model-trails/ride-centersThe PAC recognizes the desires and needs of the airport to generate revenue from its non-aviation land holdings. As such, land leases to private enterprises that can directly support the UrbanRecreation Center (e.g., outdoor recreation shops, brewery, café, hotel, restaurants) might be considered. The Center could be the hub of races attracting people from across the country.Races already occurring at Lake Crabtree County Park attract participants from all over the U.S.The community should be involved as specific sections of the Land Use Master Plan components are developed.Additionally, the PAC opposes any runway built closer to William B. Umstead State Park as shown on Alternative D, in order to protect the noise levels at the campground in the park.Thank you for your consideration,William B. Umstead Park Advisory Committee Chair and Members",8/16/2016

These are a wondrous resourcewithin our metro area. I do not see why this would be a more attractive area than the West or Northern ends of the RDU property, especially since the Crabtree sections already border a largedevelopment and would add undue traffic to congested highway I-40. These natural spaces on this side of the RDU property are more valuable to our residents left undeveloped and as a havenfor outdoor enthusiasts. It would also hamper Cub Scout / Boy Scout use of the Odd Fellows property seated right next to the Area 4 section in the plan maps.

751,"I think developing the Lake Crabtree area south of I-40 is a huge mistake. I recently relocated to the RDU area. One of the reasons I was willing to come here was because the culture andatmosphere is so unique. Amenities like Lake Crabtree are unique and noteworthy. Another business complex is not. The situation is similar to giving your child $50 as a graduation gift. It willbe long forgotten as the years go by. However, giving a unique and memorable gift will last through time. Lake Crabtree is a wonderful park that I visit multiple times per week. It provides meenjoyment and memories. I proudly tell my out-of-state friends how much I enjoy the park. Obviously, another business park will not generate a similar conversation. Developing Crabtree is onemore incremental step towards becoming unremarkable.",8/17/2016

753,"I received your email in response to my comments made during public meeting and based on your response, I don't think you are trying to find a solution that the public and the airport could getbehind and support. I see the 93 pages of comments since July 22, 2016 posted here (thank you for posting these comments) and NONE of them include support for the development of publicland, Lake Crabtree. I knew there were a lot of citizens opposed to development of Lake Crabtree and corridor to Umstead and it's nice to see the comments.That said, it seems like your response to my comment is to quote more FAA regulations instead of trying to find a solution that would meet both the recreational needs of community and therevenue needs of the airport. Lake Crabtree has been used by the public for 28 years and it seems like RDU has already decided that office space or hotel space will be developed on LakeCrabtree lands.Â I've read much of the FAA Airport Compliance Manual - 5190.6B and it doesn't cover publicly used lands at ALL. Because of this, some special consideration needs to betaken. Revenue generation is a real need for the airport and citizens understand that. There are other ways to make revenue and I've talked to many people, who have so many great ideas thathaven't even been given a seat at the negotiation table. Reconsider your position for the long term future of this community. Our grandchildren will applaud our efforts to protect a publicrecreational space more than they will remember yet another office/hotel space. Let's find a way to work together.",8/17/2016

The area around Umstead park with the numerous hiking and biking opportunities is one of themajor attractions in Triangle area. Loss of this green space will be devastating and I think will ultimately adversely affect migration to the area. Umstead park and Crabtree lake are cherishedhiking spots for my family and friends. On a personal note, the green areas around Raleigh airport and Crabtree lake is one of the sights I love to see when landing from the plane onto RDUand is one of the first sights that signals being ""home"".

820,"To whom it may concern:I grew up in Charlotte, NC and went through that airport's Master Plan several years ago. That airport had to annex areas so that they could build a 4th runway and extend another one. Aroundthe perimeter of the airport, walking/hiking/biking trails were established as well as a plane watching area. Now, CLT is one of the busiest airports in the nation. The Plan helped spur growth andcreate a ""new"" Charlotte.I support the Master Plan for RDU. It is good to look long-term and plan ahead for inevitable growth. While I understand the sentiment of the bicyclists, they must understand that the Trianglearea is growing by leaps and bounds. We as a community must be prepared for this growth or else we'll be in a huge mess and probably gridlock. RDU is closer to the East Coast than CLTand, by the way RDU is growing, RDU has the potential for being even busier than CLT. We need to plan for this growth.I would urge the Planners to incorporate some of the ideas above (i.e. bike trails around the perimeter, an UNOBSTRUCTED plane viewing platform, etc). The current plane viewing platformwas well thought out EXCEPT for one thing- Location. The current platform does not allow a totally unobstructed view of the runway. When planes land and take off, they go behind a buildingduring their ascent/descent. You lose the feel of the momentum that the plane has. Ideally, the platform would be located on the perimeter of the airport away from all terminals.RDU has the potential to bring in new carriers and new routes, both domestic and international. This means that new jobs will be created which ultimately is good for the economy. I know Iwould love to have an airport job with an airline or even in the building/planning phase of the airport itself.While there may be historic significance and sentiment to the areas that the Master Plan is looking at, I feel a good job of planning can ease the pain of progress. Incorporating history into thebuildings through art is a good way. Maybe even have a part of a wall in the terminal that tells the story of RDU through pictures and stories. I am not against the outdoors by any means. I justfeel that these things should be considered in the planning stages and have some accommodations made.Thank you for allowing me to express my views on the 2040 Master Plan for RDU.",8/22/2016

826,"I oppose the development of any of the current Crabtree recreation and parks areas for commercial or residential purposes. There are already insufficient parks in the towns of Cary andMorrisville for the growing populations.

It will sicken me to have to go out of town for a picnic, paddle or bike ride. Sincerely",8/22/2016
827,I am a biker and constant user of RDU. The thing that makes my blood boil is the quote that 'the lease can be terminated if the land is needed for aeronautical use' when a large part of the planis to build hotels and an office park. This is a simple example of city planning (public and private) trying to 'better' our city without understanding what already makes it great.,8/22/2016
828,I am opposed to the master plan 2040 that would develop land along old reedy creek Rd and at lake crabteee.

836,"I understand the profit motives for development, but I can see no good reason to develop Lake Crabtree County Park or the areas surrounding Old Reedy Creek road. While Raleigh is ingrowth mode, part of what makes this area so attractive is the green space. The mountain biking and hiking trails at LCP are some of the last remaining trails in Raleigh. By developing this land,RDU is effectively ruining outdoor activities for thousands of people for another hotel or more office space.I urge you to think beyond immediate dollars and consider the implications of a city with no green space. No hiking and biking trails. No easily accessible areas for leisure activities. The veryfoundation of Raleigh is our green space, our outdoor recreations, our culture of work mixed with activity. Please don't take this away from the citizens of Raleigh.I am completely against the development of these green spaces. Once gone, they can never be brought back. Build the hotels and office spaces somewhere else.",8/22/2016
837,"Why do you need to take all that space for development? I'm no expert in airport or urban development, zoning, etc. but RDU has never seemed busy enough to justify taking all that land.There seems to be plenty of space around the northeastern and northwestern side of the airport or north of the Sheetz station and around the parking lot, with even a semi-intelligent level ofdesign, to construct whatever ""aviation support"" construction RDU may need.There are plenty of unoccupied office spaces around Raleigh. There is plenty of room to construct more offices, hotels, commercial attractions, etc. on Page Rd, TW Alexander, or HWY 70.That land has already been developed beyond the point of being attractive for wilderness or outdoor recreation, yet is commercially viable enough, combined with conveniently located alreadyexisting attractions to suit the needs and wishes of the urban developers. It's even more convenient than the land around the airport to access places like Brier Creek, RTP, etc., beingenjoyable by locals as well as visitors. Development of the land we've already carved out for places like Brier Creek, RTP and surrounding areas, and reuse of the already existing office spacesfrom the downsizing companies like Cisco or Lenovo is much more cost effective and preserves the outdoor space that attracts residents to The Triangle in the first place. Everything I've heardabout the plan, perhaps with the exception of airport support facilities, which I've already addressed, just seems like the construction of a huge facility that won't reach the full capacity asplanned and will wind up just being a half-empty, money and resource sucking, unprofitable development.The land you're speaking of taking is hundreds of acres worth of little-disturbed natural space conveniently enough located to be enjoyed by local wildlife and thousands of outdoor enthusiastsper year. You're also encroaching on Umstead Park, basically choking nature into a smaller area and removing the largest, and really only, area of minimally disturbed land inside the 540perimeter.The plan to develop the zones as mapped is a prime example of developers' greed, unintelligent planning, and complete disregard for the opinions of the local residents, the vast majority ofwhom have nothing to do with anything that will be constructed and stand to gain absolutely no benefit from it. I highly doubt my opinion is significant enough to change anything about yourplan, but I implore you to consider it along with what I'm sure are thousands of others similar to it to reconsider your decision to take away our untouched land.",8/22/2016

839,"The forested areas marked for development include land directly adjacent to Umstead State Park and much of the land within Lake Crabtree County Park, the most heavily used park in theWake County Park system. These lands have approximately 32 miles of existing recreational trails built by local residents and are used by mountain bikers, walkers, and runnersâ€¦both adultsand childrenâ€¦groups and individuals. Some of the trails in this forested green space offer beginner/kid-friendly mountain biking and thus foster family outdoor recreation. Also, these trails areconnected to the greenway systems of both Raleigh and Cary.In addition to the loss of forested recreation space, development of these lands would remove an important green space buffer between the airport facilities and the very popular Umstead StatePark and could negatively affect the hundreds of acres within the Crabtree Creek watershed.The Airportâ€™s master planning process revealed that none of these lands are required for runways, terminals, parking, or any other facility directly related to passengers or aircraft at theRDU facility. The planners propose to use these lands for the sole purpose of generating revenue for the airport by leasing these lands out to developers to build office space, hotels, and aquarry. For all of these revenue-generating items, alternatives are available, so the destruction of forested recreation space and forested green space buffer to Umstead need not occur.Triangle Off-Road Cyclists urges the preservation of all the existing forested lands, trails, and green space within the Airport Authorityâ€™s project area which is located to the South and Eastof National Guard Drive and Aviation Parkway. We further suggest that the Airport work with surrounding municipalities to investigate the creation of an Urban Trails Center within this property.This Urban Trails Center would create business opportunities for new and existing hotels, campgrounds, restaurants, bars, bike shops, and recreation outfitters.The proximity of this forested recreation space to the urban area only increases property values and positively affects the quality of life in the Triangle region. This benefits not only existingresidents, but also helps to attract future businesses and employees. The Triangle region should look at the work which has taken place in Richmond, VA, and Chattanooga, TN to preservetrails close to population centers. Triangle Off-Road Cyclists strongly believe that the benefits from an Urban Trail Center to the community far outweigh any benefits to the community whichmight be realized by creating a few new offices, a hotel, and a quarry. Triangle Off-Road Cyclists recognize that RDU Airport is important to our area and has funding challenges it mustovercome, however, we believe an Urban Trail Center is a far better solution to the community than the land uses proposed by the Airportâ€™s plan. By working with the surroundingmunicipalities, Triangle Off-Road Cyclists firmly believe that we can craft a solution that not only brings necessary revenue to the airport, but also enhances the communities which the airportserves.",8/22/2016
840,"The majority of documentation available for this expansion is irrelevant of placing shoe shining stations and Bojangles locations around the airport, as other comments have suggested. Thebulk of information I've found deals with the third-party development of the area around Crabtree Lake in order to bring additional revenue to RDU airport, meaning business parks, hotels, chainrestaurants, and potential long-term parking for RDU. As a lifetime resident in the triangle I can attest that we actually do not need any more Bojangles, and I can shine my shoes at home. Thedevelopment we would like to see would include more local eateries and businesses, and preservation of areas that are quickly being run-over with expansive sub-divisions and business parks.The charm of the triangle lies in areas like Lake Crabtree. The area between Crabtree park and Old Reedy Creek attracts people from all around the state, but most importantly provides arecreational and athletic outdoor oasis for citizens of the triangle. There aren't many areas left like this around Raleigh and we should do everything in our power to preserve it. Once it's gone, itwill never be restored. In addition to the fact that you can likely find a number of quality hotels and business parks in the area with vacancy. Do we really need another Buffalo Wild Wings andMarriott? Those are the only places that can afford such parcels to rent. So, in addition to hurting the remaining wildlife and wooded areas here, I'd imagine it will also further stifle the localeatery scene, which is exactly what we should avoid. The people of the triangle are saturated, overrun, and quite literally sick of chain restaurants, bars, and businesses. Please build up ourlocal economy and stop with the uselessness. Alternate plans should be more encompassing and vetted more thoroughly through the eyes of the public. This acreage could be bonded by thecounty/state and paid for through a minuscule increase in certain taxes (or better use of our current taxes if McCrory is booted). Raleigh has taken on $52 million of debt to DEVELOP DortheaDix into a ""World Class"" park, yet we cannot muster the energy to PRESERVE what we already have at Lake Crabtree. Please Help!!",8/22/2016

As well, I like to see an elevated rail/monorail type system (as proposed in Alternative C) to connect rental facilities, aremote parking deck, and regional light rail.I like and encourage the proposal for a consolidated rental facility. It would certainly help expand the rental opportunities as well as on-site parking for local residence that rent from RDU airport.I think a combined rental and parking deck facility closer to 40 would be a good use of the property. Having elevated trains connecting the remote facility and rental facility to the terminals wouldencourage people to utilize the remote parking more often. Ease of access is a big reason that I do not utilize the remote parking facilities. Trains make it easier for traveling families withchildren, strollers, car seats, and roller bags.

Once they are gone, they cannot be rebuilt. What can be rebuilt, however, is the already existing rundown, empty office buildings and empty lots around other parts ofRaleigh, including the spaces along Airport Blvd. The community has put a lot of effort into building and maintaining the Lake Crabtree trails as a great place for individuals and families to enjoythe outdoors and the health benefits that come from regular outdoor activity. As mentioned, there are so many other empty buildings and empty lots in Raleigh and even near the airport -please find a way to utilize and renovate those existing commercial spaces without getting rid of the natural green spaces we are lucky enough. Enough of our tree canopy is being destroyedregularly for new construction - let's keep one of the few spaces we have left to get away from it all.Raleigh is constantly cited as one of the top places to live BECAUSE of the types of outdoor activities we have easy access to thanks to these trails. The Lake Crabtree trails are an amazingplace for mountain bikers of all skill levels, and I often see families with young children there teaching their kids to ride. Without these trails, we'd be forced to travel further from home to larger,more complicated trails, and would get to enjoy these activities far less often thanks to the greater distance. Lake Crabtree Park is a quick 10 minute ride from our house, and because of thismy boyfriend and I get out and ride these trails 5 days a week, as do many other local residents. It would be devastating to lose this.The more green space Raleigh destroys to make room for commercial building, the less appealing we become as a city for people to travel to and to relocate to.

As long as the AA canpoint to this long term income stream at market rent, it shouldn't matter whether the use is a county park or office and hotel development. The at market income stream seems to be whatmatters to the AA. It's obvious the RDUAA will not be getting into the development business itself, but will be long term ground leasing, following the model of Centennial Campus in which NCState has ground leased the entire campus to private developers on long term unsubordinated leases.",8/24/2016
878,"As if there is not enough development in and around the airport (and throughout the triangle for that matter), when will developers be able to say enough is enough and stop the ubiquitoushotels and strip malls? Especially in an area that is already jammed with the traffic on Harrison Ave. and Airport Blvd. every day. Thanks for taking time to consider what this area will need in2040, but I think it's safe to say that by then, if the bike/recreation trails are still there, they will be the ONLY ones left in the area----since what I refer to in parentheses in my first sentence willprobably do away with Beaverdam, Chapel Hill North, New Light and RTP trails.",8/24/2016
879,"This plan is a tragedy on multiple levels. First is the simple destruction of 611 acres of forested area. That type of local terrain takes hundreds of years to grow and once it is destroyed it will begenerations before it will return and it will never be the same. In a world of increasing urban sprawl these forested areas inside city limits are priceless. There are hundreds of office building andstrip malls and hotels that already exist, but only one forested trail network this close to town, which brings us to the second point.This plan is an extreme detriment to the 99% of the people who live in this community. A park with free public access offers an escape the depressing reality of pavement and office cubiclesthat so many have to work in day after day. To destroy this park only to put up another depressing visage of the exact thing so many need respite from shows a total disdain for thepsychological well being of the community. This park also offers a healthy recreation alternative to the increasingly isolated and sedentary lifestyle of most urban dwellers. Destroying access tothis park shows a complete disdain for the physical well being of the community.The area that the airport plans to destroy is also dangerously encroaching on the Umstead border. The destruction of the trees will cause extreme erosion problems and decrease thesustainability of all the local plant life in Umstead. The destruction of these 611acres will also kill or displace hundreds of local animals breaking an already fragile eco-system that existsbetween the two parks. I would challenge every single member of the RDUAA board of directors saying that if they cannot individually kill each of these animals themselves then they should notbe so flippant in doing so via construction crews. This has not even taken into consideration the waste that will be brought in from the septic systems, kitchens, and dumpsters from retail andhotel space.The points above are indicative of the lack of both consideration and ethical principals on the part of the RDUAA. This plan is brought forth by a small board of directors who have personalfinancial interest in land ""development"" who have approved this plan with only financial gain in mind without second thought for the local community or environment. An extremely small numberof people are going to make a profit at the expense of thousands, and their only justification for doing so is that their lease says they can. If this plan follows through the moral character of everysingle member of the board of directors should be called into question, and the every councilman who does nothing to stop it should lose their seat.The airport as it stands now has always delivered impeccable service to the community, but this plan would push them from an admirable business to the very picture of corporate corruption. Iimplore the RDUAA to find another way of generating the necessary revenue while maintaining this forested area and their reputation as a community friendly business. There are ways tocreate revenue without destroying the land, the parks, the trails, and the eco-system.",8/24/2016

That might be how government works, but timehas to be spent investigating what these changes mean to the citizen's quality of life, the infrastructure involved and costs associated with business development. The economic impact ofdevelopment is real and sometimes costly to quality of life and living in an area we can all enjoy. The date for a meeting to reveal the final RDU plan to the public is not established yetaccording to the website, but it appears the RDU Authority Board votes on the final plan October 20, 2016 according to one of the three websites you have.January 28, 2016, it was stated RDU had sufficient runways, but resurfacing was needed. Demand had been down due to cost of jet fuels, but recently has picked up when fuel costs werelower, tickets cheaper. I am sure that is why RDU is using the high demand statistics even though it would be more prudent to do average demand to show the need for more revenue tooperate the airport.I am an adjacent landowner and have tried to be heard, yet do not feel that I have a voice, since RDU Authority Members are appointed by County Commissioners..RDU has authority likeDurham, Morrisville, Apex,Fuquay Varina, Chapel Hill, Wake Forest, Zebulon and Raleigh, yet RDU does get funding from each of the triangle governments, and transportation taxes, but mostof the funding comes from FAA Grants according to RDU . Grant money also comes from local city and county taxes as well as Department of Transportation funds, because there is a DOTbuilding for aviation at RDU. Air travelers spend money too at the airport.What occurred the last time that RDU made their master plan, they bought up all the land around us saying it was necessary for airport expansion and to protect citizens from airport noise andpollution. We knew it was not needed, so in essence RDU has all this extra land today because they had it zoned Airport District and nothing could be built on it, yet RDU can now lease it toanyone except churches or schools. So now RDU can become a big real estate development company generating revenue that must be spent for the airport. Cities can't do that withoutpartnerships, so how can RDU?So I say, RDU Authority members John Kane and Lawrence Rucchino, my Wake county representatives, please vote against allowing lands east of the airport and adjacent to I-40 andUmstead Park become a Rock Quarry and/ more unnecessary office buildings.

920,"I don't think as many people would be as upset about commercial development on the Reedy Creek trail areas if Umstead State Park would allow mountain biking on at least 10-15 miles of well-built and fun mountain bike trail. Even though this comment form is about the airport plan, it is pretty clear that mountain biking and the lack of mountain bike access in Umstead are underlyingfactors in the current community opposition to the 2040 plan. To that end, maybe it is somehow possible that the leaders of the RDU Airport authority could reach out to the State and thisoutreach could lead to a productive dialogue between the State Park and all trail user groups in the area. And, if mountain bike access was eventually secured in Umstead, the communityoutrage at the current master plan for the Reedy Creek area might be alleviated.As a former urban planner, mountain biker and park user in general, I can see no good reason why mountain biking is fully prohibited within Umstead State Park. Currently, two state parks inNorth Carolina permit mountain biking on single-track trails (Lake Norman and Lake James). The trails at these parks are great. Umstead is big enough for hikers, bikers, and runners. There isenough acreage at Umstead and a sufficient user base so that certain trails could be open and closed for biking and hiking. Similarity, conflicts could be avoided by having directional trails.Economic development wise, mountain biking is a no-brainer for cities that want to attract and retain young, smart, and healthy individuals. If there were mountain bike trails near the airport, Ibet some business travelers who like to ride would actually stay at those hotels which could be built on RDU land. Also, if the trails are really good, some people might actually fly here to ride onthe weekend, or even move here (so their family would have to fly here). This type of indirect economic impact is usually ignored when the direct impact of commercial development exceedsmillions of dollars. But, if leaders choose to ignore it, they are also ignoring an opportunity to create a more resilient, healthy, and prosperous Triangle. Just look at cool mountain bike towns likeAsheville and Bend OR. Yeah, these places are in the mountains, but I ride a lot, and I actually enjoy the terrain near the Airport more, especially because it is so close to many vibrant urbancenters. Meaning, it is nice to get done with a ride and be able to hit a brew pub within 10 minutes. I've been around the country biking, trails this close to burgers and beer is not a normal thing.Plus, Mountain bikers have and spend money. First, these bikes are not cheap and they must be maintained. Second, the appetite one gets after a ride usually leads to big tickets atrestaurants.If the area is developed as planned, then the Triangle will start to be just like every other medium sized metropolis, paved over, boring, and without miles of trails. Trails are the new amenity,regardless of how people access them. Finally,there are plenty of other areas near the airport where commercial development could be located and serve the needs of the population. But,there are not any other areas near the airport where one can ride, hike, or run 15 miles in a mature upland forested area. They way I see it, this, like so many other things, is fueled by profitmotives. We need profits, but we also need open space. Why does RDU need to be its own city in 2040? Can't RTP accommodate all the commercial development this part of the regionneeds? Are there ways that commercial development could be built on the existing footprint of the RDU site?I hope something I have written helps our leaders make a decision that is the best for the people and environment of our region.",8/30/2016

933,"As a resident of Westborough who knows every day whether you’re using R23 or R5, we have noticed a much noisier airport since the airlines have all merged and reduced seats, requiringmany more connections instead of directs. Whereas most airport noise started at 6 am back in the golden days, American now sends their american eagle commuters to connecting hubs at 5am. The airlines are making money hand over fist squeezing passengers into tiny planes and difficult itineraries, so I assume RDU is getting a good percentage of that. It seems the least youcould do is try to compensate for becoming a worse, noiser resident of Raleigh by becoming a good steward of land, limiting asphalt and caring about the quality of life of all these people buyingall these houses they’re building along US70W and Ebenezer Church Rd.

I live in NorthDurham and commute about 25 miles to Cary to work near the Crabtree and Umstead parks. One of the reasons for returning to work in the Wake County / Cary area (after two years workingin Durham) was the recreational and fitness trails available in the parks. Again, I have chosen to work in Wake / Cary over my home city and county because of Crabtree and Umstead!I understand that the authority has the right to do with its land as it pleases. But I also know that doing whatever is allowed may not be the best thing for the authority's long-term support in thecommunity; moreover, taking away the most popular trails and park in the county would greatly hurt the attractiveness of area employers, which ultimately would also negatively impact theairport itself.Please reconsider--the value of other parcels as commercial areas are improved by having the natural look of Umstead and Crabtree, and the trails/park also improve the value of developmentsin those other areas.",9/2/2016

She has been an inspiration to my life as well as a blessing in disguise as I have suffered from clinical depression since 2004. Long story,short, Lake crabtree and Umstead park are dear memories to me each year, both to myself to rejuvenate and also for my dog's pleasure in the outdoors. Notably, the past 10 years, I havefrequented these places at least twice a week (totaling in approx. to 1000 times without exaggeration), including black creek trail, old reedy creek road's bridal trail, and also lake crabtree's 5mile trail that circles the entire area.I was writing to please note that:I OPPOSE a runway built closer to Umstead Park--this option definitely is a cause for concern for animal and nature's survival.I also OPPOSE a quarry built next to Umstead Park on environmental exposed lands that drain into the Park and alongside and into Crabtree Creek which runs throughout Umstead as well.I OPPOSE the destruction of the forested lands off Old Reedy creek road that are next to Umstead Park as well; these areas have been a sanctuary for prayer and a sense of peace as anescape from the hustle and bustle, per se, of city life around RTP.

I have worked with countless folks that have enjoyed this area for recreation foryears. Yes, some have enjoy those areas that aren't sanctioned by the airport authority. I encourage your leaders to consider that over the years the amount of folks that have recreated in thesewoods, both within Lake Crabtree Park and off Old Reedy Creek, has grown exponentially. Is there a was for RDU to capture the benefits of this usage growth? What other economic, oreconomics-affecting, realm has seen this level of steady growth before, during and after the Recession?In reflection about RDUs Vision 2040 plans, I've realized that there is unlikely to be another green space in the Triangle that, if developed, would affect more people in our region. I've met manyfolks that set roots in this area specifically for the quality of work-life opportunities. Access to outdoor recreation is an immense part of this balance. Wth its central location and proximity toNorth Carolina's densest population and many large employers, it is possible that RDU's collective forested lands can continue to help attract those companies, families and individuals thatmake this region the success that it is.This request might not be the quickest funds creator, but in a Vision2080, it has the potential to be the most sustaining for a healthy Triangle.

This is a conditionagreed to by Wake County in their management of the property.""Parcel 2 is currently leased to Wake County for recreational purposes, including mountain biking. Research has shown that in counties with higher acreages of recreational space, more peoplemeet the recommended daily levels of physical activity (NRPA, 2011). In addition, research also shows that exposure to natural areas hastens recovery from stress (Kaplan & Kaplan, 1989)and fosters higher-order cognitive functioning (Ulrich, 1993). On the level of ecosystem services, the presence of trees in natural areas removes CO2 from the air, and the presence of treesnear Lake Crabtree provides a natural method of water filtration and flood control.If that land is needed for aviation development to support aeronautical purposes, then I wholeheartedly support RDU in its development. However, the map of potential land-use concepts slatesthat the land in Parcel 2 would be redeveloped for office/hotel/recreation. In that, I question how and in what way the development of office and/or hotel space is needed to support aeronauticalpurposes? Is terminating the lease valid if this land is not directly being used for aeronautical purposes? If not, the benefits of maintaining this natural recreational space provides the localcommunity (which serves as frequent consumer of RDU's services) with intangible, but vital, benefits for public and environmental health.Kaplan, R. and Kaplan, S.

The Use of Property forRevenue Production. P.L. No. 80-289 specifically authorized the GSA to transfer such surplus nonairport property as needed to develop sources of revenue from nonaeronautical commercialbusinesses at a public use airport. This essentially became the point at which the FAA began tracing the requirement to use airport property for aeronautical purposes. If the property is not usedfor aeronautical purposes directly, the property must be used to generate revenue for the benefit of the airport consistent with FAA’s Policy and Procedures Concerning the Use of AirportRevenue, 64 Fed. Reg. 7696, February 16, 1999 (Revenue Use Policy). The FAA must approve the use for nonaeronautical purposes before such use is allowed.”https://www.faa.gov/airports/resources/publications/federal_register_notices/media/obligation_final99.pdf D. Providing Property for Public Community Purposes Making airport property availableat less than fair market rental value for public recreational and other community uses, for the purpose of maintaining positive airport-community relations, can be a legitimate function of anairport proprietor in operating the airport. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, providing airport land for such purposes will not be considered a violation of the self sustaining requirement.Generally, the circumstances in which below-market use of airport land for community purposes will be considered consistent with the grant assurances are: 1. The contribution of the airportproperty enhances public acceptance of the airport in a community in the immediate area of the airport; the property is put to a general public use desired by the local community; and the publicuse does not adversely affect the capacity, security, safety or operations of the airport. Examples of acceptable uses include public parks, recreation facilities, and bike or jogging paths.Examples of uses that would not be eligible are road maintenance equipment storage; and police, fire department, and other government facilities if they do not directly support the operation ofthe airport. 2. The property involved would not reasonably be expected to produce more than de minimis revenue at the time the community use is contemplated, and the property is notreasonably expected to be used by an aeronautical tenant or otherwise be needed for airport operations in the foreseeable future. When airport property reasonably may be expected to earnmore than minimal revenue, it still may be used for community purposes at less than FMV if the revenue earned from the community use approximates the revenue that could otherwise begenerated, provided that the other provisions of VII. D. are met. 3. The community use does not preclude reuse of the property for airport purposes if, in the opinion of the airport sponsor, suchreuse will provide greater benefits to the airport than continuation of the community use. 4. Airport revenue is not to be used to support the capital or operating costs associated with thecommunity use.",9/26/2016

999,"Dear RDU authorities,I strongly oppose plans for commercial development in lands that are currently part of Lake Crabtree County Park. Although they have leased the areas and many of the trails areunofficial, itâ€™s obvious that the local community values the open space and recreational access over more commercial retail facilities. In addition, pockets of nature provide connectivity andcritical habitat for wildlife species in an area that is developing rapidly.I find the plans very hard to decipher. A simple map showing the existing and proposed use would help all parties evaluate the plan. I am incredulous that the RDU Authority has notcollaborated with Lake Crabtree County Park, the most-popular park in the Wake County Parks System.I urge RDU to think beyond the immediate revenue and consider more creative opportunities to plan the necessary expansion and generate revenue, while preserving the green space that is ina rapidly growing area of the Research Triangle Area. Big-picture thinking that addresses the needs of the community is what would make RDU stand out among other airports in rapidlygrowing urban environments.Best regards",10/8/2016
1000,"As a local resident of the triangle area, I wish to submit comments opposing the RDU Vision 2040 plan. It simply does not meet the needs of the citizens served by the airport. The preferredplan is simply ""horse and buggy"" type planning and development that has plagued our economy for the past few decades. This type of urban sprawl not only is bad for the environment, it is noteconomically sustainable.There is a terrific opportunity for RDU to collaborate with area use groups and make this location a recreational destination not just for existing residents but would increase tourism.Ecotourism is fast becoming one of the best investments that can be made. Outdoor recreation, ecological restoration and urban open space have proven to be economically beneficial.I urge you to support the collaborative plan, ""A Better Vision RDU 2040"" that will be presented by RDU Forest Trail Center at the public meeting this week. Their plan actually meets FAArequirements far better than the currently proposed alternative and will be the best for RDU, citizens and the environment.",10/10/2016

Umstead State Park which will likely cause devastating damage to the water quality and quantity to Crabrtree Creek. I also oppose arunway closer to William B.

The loss of this forested area and lake, which are enjoyed by mountain bikers, hikers, fishermen, boaters, and others to urban hotels, offices, and a quarry would be a tragedy for thisregion. Respectfully request that you maintain this irreplaceable forested green space and consider turning these lands into an urban trail center, the RDU Forest Trail Center. Revenues in theform of day passes would be an alternative, and in keeping with a green initiative. Please save this beautiful oasis of green space!",10/11/2016

I am part of several run andrucking groups that regularly use the parks, greenways and trails throughout Umstead, Crabtreek County Park as well as the spaces in between. These areas are incredibly valuable to me andother residents as green spaces and forests and provide a great life balance to professionals who seek the Triangle as a place to call home. This space is the perfect location to connect toareas greenway between Raleigh and Morrisville and even into Durham to allow walkers, runners, cyclists (and any other foot transportation modes) to transverse between these Triangle areasand enjoy the awesome outdoors! The idea of generating income through the creation of the Forest Trail Center is highly supported by me and others like me!!",10/11/2016

Our vision is to connect the Eastern Seaboard by human powered mobility. Our route is currently over 31% on greenways, with more than 50% in construction, funded, or inactive planning. Walkers, runners, and bicyclists already make over 10 million visits to the ECG annually for recreation and commuting.Of all metropolitan areas the ECG route runs through, the Triangle has the most complete stretch (over 90%) of off-road, shared-use trails on the entire ECG route. Over 800,000 hikers,cyclists, runners, and others visit the ECG in the Triangle annually.A key segment of our Triangle ECG section connects Cary's Black Creek Greenway and Raleigh's greenway network through Umstead State Park.

1077,"Disappointed that you hold a public meeting on Rosh Hashanah evening--October 11, 2016. These forums should be available for all community members.When will the next one be held? Christmas Day?",10/11/2016
1078,"Thanks for your diligence in fostering this stakeholder process. I was born in Raleigh in 1957. I have memories of going to this airport when Piedmont Airlines was a big deal. I have also utilizedthe parks around the airport extensively since my childhood. In recent years I have been using Crabtree Lake for sailing, lots of biking, and taking my sons. I ride and hike Umstead parkconstantly. Many of the key relationships in my life all have traces in this park area around the airport, and definitely arrivals and departures at the Airport. In other words, lots of strong emotionsand memories have their pushpin centered on the ATC tower at RDU.I would like to see the long range plan for this airport include development of aerospace industry in RTP. I wish we had Honda Jet here, but there are dozens of opportunities, and they mightentail some capacity building at our universities. Software for aerospace should thrive here. Software for aviation operations could thrive here, especially big data start ups focused on aviation.I am very intent that there be a light rail connection between the airport and the national railway system routed through Cary and Morrisville. There has to be a way to use some of the propertyin contention for a right of way, and in trade for more right of way, that would benefit the region and enhance the mission and charter of RDU. This is what works in Washington DC, but fails inAtlanta and Denver. Connections on this light Rail would go very far toward giving a RTP a second life as a technology center.We already have a recreational Mecca, particularly biking, in this domain. I would uphold the Colorado Vail resort center in the summer time as a model for a development scheme that wouldembrace the current users of this region rather than alienate them. In Colorado I am very accustomed to having bike shops, coffee, recreational equipment companies right on the bicycle pathsdeveloped by the counties and cities. If you need to do commercial development - why not create concessions for the kind of businesses that serve the recreational and environmentalcommunities. - I would especially embrace the inclusion of a CONFERENCE / RETREAT center that could be offered to non-profits at affordable rates. The kind of place that could function as aregional town hall for the entire Triangle, and be an easy draw for the air traveling recreational community (trade shows?)I am very ambivalent about expanding the scope of operations for the Quarry operation. I see the practical sensibility of this direction though (unlike some of my peers.) If you pursue thistrajectory, I would stridently recommend other development tactics that mediate the environmental consequences of this choice. (Trail expansion, environmental education center, pool forTriathlete training, ropes course, bike shop / protein smoothie concession, etc.)I am also very concerned about Superfund site at Crabtree Lake. Remediation of the PCB contamination there needs careful exposition in your plan for me to embrace it.Finally, I clearly have an environmental agenda, although I am pragmatic. Base speculative commercial development will compel me to campaign very hard with RDU member institutions inDurham to block the plan in every bureaucratically tedious way possible. I say that with a wry sense of humor. But truly.respectfully",10/11/2016
1079,"Looking forward to learning the preferred alternative. I prefer Alternative C, but regardless, here are four points to consider:1) build new runways farthest from Terminal 2, then extend terminal(s) and aviation uses towards them;2) plan and build not just for origin-destination demand, but also for transfer traffic so a hub(s) could function;3) work with airline and industry representatives to meet their needs, etc. (in other words, don't ""box out"" potential development by constructing infrastructure too ""tightly"");4) develop as much airport property as possible to generate revenue for the capital improvements",10/11/2016
1080,The proposed land use plan does not respect the interest and values of the community. A strong and vibrant airport is built around a strong and vibrant community. Additional quarries and olfzeparks do not strengthen out community. The RDU greenspace including the trails at Lake Crabtree Country Park and surronding areas are already a destination for varied groups of people formall walks of life.

1105,"I attended tonight's event 10/11/2016 from 5:00-8:00 p.m.at the Marriott for the RDU Airport Vision 2040 9th Workshop according to RDU. Most of the previous meetings were the samepresentation held in pairs one day apart, once in Durham and once in Raleigh, so in reality, the same information was presented twice. As I interpret this, there were 4 actual meetings. I haveattended all meetings except Land Use and General Aviation because Land Use were added at June meeting when the nine alternatives were revealed. Both meetings were single day eventsheld at RDU facilities. With Land Use meeting, it was held just days before the 4th of July week and revealed the four alternatives and proposals for leasing out surplus land to finance RDU. Ihad flown to California for a family vacation planned many months prior. I was told by CEO Landguth that the General aviation meeting needed to be added in a phone conversation I had andthat it was was only for general aviation pilots. Plans tonight revealed an alternative plan that had parts of all the other four alternative plans that Ricchono and Associates had proposed at lastmeeting June 28th. It was not what I expected, especially when the airport revealed the RDU Authority vote would now be based only on aeronautical aspects, not on land use. This vote willtake place next Thursday October 20th by RDU authority members, so I at least hope the Authority members will be able to read the comments after last night's meeting. I feel this is like thejudge telling a jury of twelve about the law that the jury is trying to uphold when they deliver their verdict. Another way to look at that is, we are only going to vote on the plans that affect RDUand disregard land use and general aviation use. When the plans are completed it will be up to RDU Airport Authority to decide on what happens because no one votes for RDU Authoritymembers...they are all appointed by local governments. FAA reviewers, RDU Authority Members, RDU Staff, and advisers if you are listening, ..what has all this effort meant... why are we notconsidering land use as a part of the FAA plan to be submitted. Land Use effects most citizens and not a single landowner serves on any committee. In order words the ones to make decisionsare not landholder stakeholders, but business members at the airport. This is not what FAA wants to happen.This is not the FAA way which according to their website indicates adjacent homeowners are ""vested"" stakeholders as owners.This is not acceptable to me as a citizen, because the land use is the most important aspect of RDU Vision 2040 and it was in my opinion, that if you do not reveal Land Use as a needed andimportant factor in the RDU Vision 2040 then RDU made a mistake, and makes RDU staff's transparency suspect. You, RDU authority should have known from past experiences that citizenswant to know what your land use decisions are before the final decision that is appropriate is made....This is why public hearings should be held to learn what the public wants to happen to theirland.. ( The public teacher I was , is coming out in me now) I have lived in the same house adjacent to RDU since 1971 and have seen many changes at the airport. I do hope the Airportauthority makes sure they are voting for what the general public believes is the best for RDU airport, which is not to destroy Umstead Park. Adjacent landowners are major stakeholders inRDU's expansion. This includes landowners on all sides of the airport...North south, east or west...not just me. I can see how subdivisions off of Westgate Dr. or Mt Herman church roadunderstand when they see airplanes overhead at all times during the day. As a teacher, I witnessed airplanes over the playground at Cedar Fork Elementary in the South area Town Hall Drive,Morrisville. Think about all the 580 students involved at that school when I taught there. I wondered why this school was built in the flight path of the the runway. I also wonder how Baps IndianTemple was approved as an assembly meeting place when they were in Airport District Zoning. I continue to wonder how Brier Creek was developed when many of Durham Countydisapproved of RDU plans in the 70's.I suspect that folks in the Research Triangle know about the dangers of airplanes overhead just as I have, when a big jet comes over I-40 as I travel.",10/12/2016
1106,"According to RDU's website 50% of the airport's 5000 acres of land is listed as surplus. Then why can it not be sold or invested to help the counties that created the RDU AirportAuthority(Wake, Durham and Orange County). These three separate counties, plus many local cities like Durham, Raleigh, Cary, Chapel Hill, Apex, Zebulon, Holly Springs,Garner, Wendell,Wake Forest,Carrboro and probably some others , are all involved in supporting RDU become the international airport they have become. Wake County Leaders, this affects the next 25 yearsof growth in Wake and surrounding areas. I think these citizens have not be informed about what is occuring, especially when the last press release was sent out just four days before the publichearing tonight...This meeting was also scheduled at the same time of the McCory/Cooper Governor's debate and Triangle Land Conservancy Special meeting night, both of which I wish Icould have attended. I choose RDU Public Hearing tonight which was added according to speakers tonight.It now appears most of the development according to the final plan tonight occurs in Wake County and that Durham and Chapel Hill are not involved. That is not true because the citizens are allinvolved in taxes paid to support RDU. If RDU authority decides that a rock quarry and parking lots are what are necessary for aeronautical development in the triangle area, then RDU Authorityis not aware of what the average citizen wants:Some of the things I learned tonight:1. Better Roadways in the terminal area and Commerce Blvd concept road which will be constructed along the RDU borders from Lumley road to Aviation parkway. This will connect theNorthern area with the eastern area where the parking economy lots exist now. Expansion plans indicate they will make up to five additional parking lots so that revenue is generated.2. Move 5L/23R over to the Durham side and extend the runway to 11,500 foot runway. This will increase taxiways and eliminate current runway, but will increase space between terminals andgates.3. Rental Car Terminals will be moved to area between the terminals.4. Ground Transportation Centers established at both terminals. No plans for rapid transit yet at RDU, but will listen to that idea.5. Additional facilities along National Guard Drive will be constructed as the need arises. I suspect that parking will be misplaced at the central airport and those that travel may now need to usebus transportation to park their cars. Presently those who choose, can park close by and pay the fees to RDU to park close to their gate of departure. If rental car facilities are placed betweenthe terminals then rental cars need to park somewhere within that area also.6. Support of General Aviation plans, place new hangers and land for planes near National Guard facility, Umstead Park and old General Aviation runway.7. Plans, powerpoint, and drawings for this ""hybridized"" final alternative, added the term aviation support/recreation to several parcels of land on east side of airport property and toldparticipants at the public hearing tonight RDU is listening to your over 1000 comments about recreation.Thanks again to...and his group for getting the comments through Oct 10th on the RDU website before the meeting today.
