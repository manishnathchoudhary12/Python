They are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions, dmorfx.exe and dtax.exe, you can also find a version of aaplay.exe there, with which you can view files you create with dta.exe or dtax.exe. I downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing away the afternoons since. The programmes are all a bit buggy and definitely not-ready-to-spread-to-the-masses, but they are very well written. The interface is frustrating at first, but it gets easy once you figure out the tricks. I have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morph without using the splines option. Not sure why, since I don't have the source. I think it was written for TP 6.0. If anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing to work right, tell me; it took me several hours the first time just to figure out that if I just used the durned splines then it would work... -Ryan rap@cis.ufl.edu \n",

      "Hello, I am looking to add voice input capability to a user interface I am developing on an HP730 (UNIX) workstation. I would greatly appreciate information anyone would care to offer about voice input systems that are easily accessible from the UNIX environment. The names or adresses of applicable vendors, as well as any experiences you have had with specific systems, would be very helpful. Please respond via email; I will post a summary if there is sufficient interest. Thanks, Ken P.S.
